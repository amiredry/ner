WARSAW 1996-08-28
Russian security chief <PERSON>Aleksander Lebed</PERSON> faces an almost impossible task in Chechnya and is likely to be sidelined , Polish Foreign Minister <PERSON>Dariusz Rosati</PERSON> was reported as saying on Wednesday .
According to best-selling daily <PERSON>Gazeta Wyborcza , Rosati</PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION>Polish parliament's foreign affairs committee</ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that the fact Lebed had been charged with resolving the conflict in Chechnya showed he would be marginalised .
" It is almost impossible to gain success in this , " it quoted Rosati as saying during a committee debate .
" Lebed has no diplomatic experience .
Yeltsin sent him there to compromise him .
This tactical manoeuvre also shows that in the ruling circle there is no unity of action , " he said .
Lebed , who has arranged a military truce with separatist rebels in the southern Russia region , was in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> this week seeking support for a deal on Chechnya's political status .
But Russian President <PERSON>Boris Yeltsin</PERSON> has seemed unwilling to meet his envoy and went on holiday on Monday .
Gazeta Wyborcza quoted Rosati as saying Yeltsin was very ill and effectively on leave , but for now retained control in Russia although matters were passing into the hands of his close collaborators .
Rosati said <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>'s July polls , in which Yeltsin won re-election , showed democracy had passed an important test and the Russian people had chosed the path of further reforms .
But he said a power struggle in Russia's ruling circles could not be ruled out , which could harm further reforms .
He expressed concern over problems in the Russian economy , saying this could lead to social unrest , the daily reported .
On Moscow's foreign policy , Rosati said it had changed its stance on NATO's eastward expansion and was preparing itself for <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>'s inevitable entry into the Western alliance .
He also reportedly criticised Russian Foreign Minister <PERSON>Yevgeny Primakov</PERSON> , saying his style of work resembled that of the Soviet-era 1970s and 1980s .
