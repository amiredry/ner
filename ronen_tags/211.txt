Huge Windows 95 sales fail to meet expectations .

A year after its massively publicized introduction , <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft Corp.</ORGANIZATION><PRODUCT>'s Windows 95</PRODUCT> computer operating system has fallen short of the most optimistic expectations for the software giant and the industry .
Even though more than 40 million copies of <PRODUCT>Windows 95</PRODUCT> have been sold , making it the fastest-selling new software ever , it would have been impossible for any product to live up to the unprecedented hype of the Aug. 24 , 1995 launch , when stores around the world opened at midnight to greet long lines of customers .
The Redmond , Wash.-based company spent tens of millions of dollars promoting the product with stunts that included buying the entire print run of the <ORGANIZATION>Times of London and lighting New</ORGANIZATION> York's Empire State building in a Windows color scheme .
But the product , delivered eight months late , has fallen short of its sales potential in part because <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> delivered a mixed message to business customers , analysts said .
" It didn't do as well as it could have , " said Rob Enderle , an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Giga Information Group</ORGANIZATION> .
Scores of software and hardware companies that had hoped for a big boost in sales were disappointed when only a brief spike materialized .
" People who were expecting major coat-tails were somewhat disappointed , " said <PERSON>Scott Winkler</PERSON> , an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Gartner Group .</ORGANIZATION>
" It's not as though it hasn't had an impact , " he said . "
It just hasn't had the huge earth-shattering impact some people were looking for . "
<ORGANIZATION>Symantec Corp.</ORGANIZATION> , which had been among the most bullish of software companies at the time of the <PRODUCT>Windows 95</PRODUCT> launch , ended up posting disappointing financial results when retail sales of the operating system fell short of its projections .
<ORGANIZATION>Touchstone Software Corp.</ORGANIZATION> had to pay $ 1.3 million in cash and stock to settle a shareholders lawsuit brought after the company's sales failed to meet expectations tied to the <PRODUCT>Windows 95</PRODUCT> launch .
Many software developers apparently saw their crucial holiday season sales suffer last year because store shelves were jammed with blue-and-white boxes of Windows 95 , resulting in a shortage of space for seasonal products , said Ann Stephens , president of PC Data Inc .
To be sure , sales of <PRODUCT>Windows 95</PRODUCT> and the accompanying Office 95 upgrade drove Microsoft sales up 46 percent last year to a record <CURRENCY>$ 8.67 billion</CURRENCY> and cemented the company's status as the industry's dominant company .
<ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> executives say they are thrilled with the sales figures , and industry analysts estimate that by sometime next year , the installed base of <PRODUCT>Windows 95</PRODUCT> will surpass that of the older version of Windows , now used on about 100 million computers worldwide .
But Enderle said the figure could have been even higher if <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> had done a better job of handling the huge demand for technical support from customers who were frustrated trying to install the system .
He and other analysts said corporate America adopted a go-slow approach because <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> already was promoting the new version of its high-end <PRODUCT>Windows NT operating system</PRODUCT> , expected to be available in stores in the next several weeks .
" <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> sent a lot of signals that NT was going to be the answer , " <PERSON>Winkler</PERSON> said . "
Many people began to believe that Windows 95 was being downplayed . "
But now that <PRODUCT>Windows NT 4.0</PRODUCT> has been launched , Winkler and others believe only a relatively small proportion of corporate users will elect to pay the added software and hardware costs needed to use it instead of <PRODUCT>Windows 95</PRODUCT> .
" <PRODUCT>Windows 95</PRODUCT> is going to do great , " he said . "
The mistake people made was in thinking it was going to be a fast , sweeping change rather than a slow , building change . "
