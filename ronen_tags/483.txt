Top prices in <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> / southern Minnesota Tuesday were expected to range from mostly <CURRENCY>$ 59.50</CURRENCY> to <CURRENCY>$ 60.00</CURRENCY> , steady following a <CURRENCY>$ 0.50 - $ 1.50</CURRENCY> jump Monday .
Illinois tops were seen matching Monday's at <CURRENCY>$ 59.00</CURRENCY> with tops in Indiana at <CURRENCY>$ 57.50</CURRENCY> .
However , <ORGANIZATION>USDA</ORGANIZATION> reported tops of <CURRENCY>$ 58.00</CURRENCY> in <LOCATION>Illinois</LOCATION> and in <LOCATION>Iowa / southern Minnesota</LOCATION> <CURRENCY>, $ 60.00</CURRENCY> on some hogs Monday .
Attempts to move prices higher again Tuesday could be offset by expected increased hog marketings this week , sources said .
Producers were expected to ship as many hogs as they can ahead of the Labor Day holiday weekend , they said .
Demand for hogs is expected to be light by the end of the week , as the industry prepares for Labor Day , Monday , September 1 when most U.S. packers will be closed .
