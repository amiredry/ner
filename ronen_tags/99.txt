Miss Universe , <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION><PRODUCT>'s Alicia Machado</PRODUCT> , left New Mexico on Thursday , refusing to answer questions about her weight or claims she was told to either go on a crash diet or give up her title .
<PERSON>Machado</PERSON> , 19 , flew to Los Angeles after slipping away from the <ORGANIZATION>New Mexico</ORGANIZATION> desert town of <LOCATION>Las Cruces</LOCATION> , where she attended the 1996 Miss Teen USA pageant on Wednesday .
While <PERSON>Machado</PERSON> was not a contestant here , she came under intense scrutiny following reports she was given an ultimatum by <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION>-based <ORGANIZATION>Miss Universe Inc.</ORGANIZATION> to drop 27 pounds ( 12 kg ) in two weeks or risk losing her crown .
In Venezuela , her mother told Reuters that Machado had a swollen face when she left home two weeks ago because she had her wisdom teeth extracted .
<PERSON>Marta Fajardo</PERSON> insisted her daughter , who weighed 112 pounds ( 51 kg ) when she won the Miss Universe title in Las Vegas in May , had perfectly normal eating habits .
" Everybody has their own addiction to something or other but it's not as if she eats cakes like crazy , " she said .
Organisers flatly denied ever threatening Machado but immediately put her under wraps and blocked access to her .
Dressed in a black strapless evening gown at Wednesday's pageant , <PERSON>Machado</PERSON> was clearly heavier than the contestants but still won rave reviews after her brief appearance on stage .
" Are you kidding ?
She's fantastic , " said <PERSON>Nikki Campbell</PERSON> , 28 , who went to the pageant . "
She looked great .
Very sexy . "
<PERSON>Machado</PERSON>'s publicists said on Thursday she was scheduled to stay in Los Angeles for promotional work with sponsors before returning to <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> on Sept .
Beauty queens are high-profile personalities in Venezuela and <PERSON>Machado</PERSON>'s alleged weight problem made front page news this week .
It was an official of the Miss Venezuela Organisation who first said <PERSON>Machado</PERSON> had been told to lose weight fast .
People close to her said she then eased up on her diet and indulged her passion for pasta and cake , but it was not clear how many pounds she gained and most people who saw her said she was still a long way from being fat .
Martin Brooks , president of Miss Universe Inc , said he spoke with Machado to assure her that organisers were not putting pressure on her .
" She's fine with it .
She wished , as we all did , that it hadn't happened but she's spiritually and mentally terrific .
There's no problem whatsoever , " he told <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION> .
He said the lifestyle associated with being Miss Universe could make routine exercise difficult .
" The problem is they travel so much and are so busy that the ability to have any type of regimented routine workout doesn't exist .
I dont know if Alicia is working out .
We haven't talked about it because it hasn't been an issue , " he said .
