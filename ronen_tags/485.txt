Actor Reeve highlights Democrats ' first night .
CHICAGO 1996-08-26
The highlights of the first day of the Democratic convention on Monday were expected to feature a mix of party leaders and people who have overcome adversity .
Among the latter were gun control advocate Sarah Brady and actor Christopher Reeve and the politicians included Rep .
<PERSON>Richard Gephardt</PERSON> and Sen .
Thomas Daschle .
Here are thumbnail profiles of the convention's key Monday speakers .
Sarah Brady -- The nation's toughest gun control law is named after <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON>'s press secretary <PERSON>James Brady</PERSON> but it was his wife who was the major force behind its passage .
As head of Handgun Control Inc. , <PERSON>Sarah Brady</PERSON> , 54 , campaigned nonstop for tough gun control in the years following the shooting of her husband and then President Reagan in 1981 .
Her reward was the passage in 1993 of the " Brady Bill " which requires a mandatory five-day waiting period for purchase of handguns and also mandates background checks for would-be gun purchasers .
Reagan recovered fully from his wounds but Brady , who was close to death after being shot by <PERSON>John Hinckley Jr .</PERSON>
, suffered serious brain damage .
Sarah was Brady's second wife and they have a son , <PERSON>James Scott Brady Jr .</PERSON>
Before the assassination attempt , she had worked for Republican congressmen and for the Republican Party .
Christopher Reeve -- Reeve was best known for playing the comic book hero Superman in four movies but his greatest heroics came in real life .
Reeve , an accomplished rider who owned several horses , suffered multiple injuries including two shattered neck vertebrae when he was thrown from his horse at an equestrian event in Culpepper , Virginia , on May 27 , 1995 .
Almost entirely paralyzed , Reeve underwent extensive surgery to fuse the vertebrae to the base of the skull and prevent any further damage to his spine .
That allowed him to be moved to a semi-upright position .
Over time he regained the power of speech , so much so that he was asked to address the opening night of the Democratic National Convention .
Reeve , 43 , was classically trained as an actor but became the prototypical handsome leading man .
He performed in summer stock and soap operas before being plucked as an almost unknown to play the lead in " Superman " and three sequels .
<PERSON>Richard Gephardt</PERSON> -- Gephardt , House Democratic leader , is a politician with a " Mr Clean " reputation who sought the presidency eight years ago and is widely believed to still have ambitions for the job .
<PERSON>Gephardt</PERSON> , 55 , the son of a milkman from a working class district of <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> , is a consummate congressional insider , sufficiently skilled in compromise and the ways of the legislature to manage the often-unruly House Democrats .
A former lawyer , he was in the front line of President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON>'s battle with the Republican-led <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> over the budget but has opposed the president's decision to sign the Republican-written welfare reform bill .
He advocated tough action against foreign countries to cut U.S. trade deficits but sometimes been out of step with the party's liberal wing .
He was an opponent of abortion until 1986 and voted for President <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON>'s big tax cut bill .
Gephardt , a red-haired square-jawed man , is a less than fiery orator .
His 1988 bid for the Democratic nomination only took off after he recreated himself as a firebreathing reformer of the establishment , standing up for blue collar workers and farmers .
<PERSON>Tom Daschle -- Daschle</PERSON> , 48 , was largely unknown outside Washington and his state of <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> when he surprisingly beat more prominent rivals to become Senate Democratic leader after the party lost its majority to the Republicans in 1994 .
A mild-mannered and youthful man who rose rapidly after entering the Senate in 1987 , he presented himself as a Midwest moderate , as a Democratic winner in a Republican state able to unite Senate factions .
Concern that he might be steamrollered by the vastly more experienced Republican leader Bob Dole was dispelled when he showed a tough edge , outmaneuvering Dole in a wrangle over scrapping a gas tax and raising the federal minimum wage .
In his early Senate years he was seen as a " prairie populist " , working on legislation protecting farmers ' prices and also on compensating veterans sickened by Agent Orange defoliant spraying in the Vietnam War .
Daschle was a key player in President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON>'s failed attempt at sweeping healthcare changes but when he became minority leader he declared he would be no water-carrier for the <ORGANIZATION>White House</ORGANIZATION> .
He has made clear he opposed <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s signing of the Republican-initiated welfare reform bill .
He has spent his adult life in politics , coming to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> as an aide in 1972 after three years in the Air Force and then being elected to the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> himself in 1978 .
