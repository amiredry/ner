A consortium of telephone companies and <ORGANIZATION>The Walt Disney Co .</ORGANIZATION>
said Thursday it had signed a <CURRENCY>$ 1 billion</CURRENCY> contract with Zenith to make digital televison set-top boxes for its home entertainment service .
The announcement of the contract for 3 million set-top boxes gave new hope to Zenith , which has struggled with years of losses .
" This really indicates we're back in the business , " <PERSON>William Luehrs</PERSON> , president of the Glenview , Ill.-based company's Networks Services Division , said in a telephone interview . "
Anytime somebody gets the opportunity to enter the next era with such a big bang has got to be seen as a strong message to the industry . "
Following the announcement , <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION>'s stock soared <CURRENCY>$ 5.50</CURRENCY> to <CURRENCY>$ 16.875</CURRENCY> on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> .
The consortium , called Americast , said the contract was part of its strategy to develop and market the next generation in home entertainment .
In addition to Disney , Americast's partners are phone companies <ORGANIZATION>Ameritech Corp.</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>BellSouth Corp.</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>GTE Corp</ORGANIZATION>. and <ORGANIZATION>SBC Communications</ORGANIZATION> .
Americast said <ORGANIZATION>Southern New England Telecommunications Corp.</ORGANIZATION> has signed a letter of intent to join the group , which plans to provide a home entertainment service similar to cable television .
Zenith also said it planned to build a new <CURRENCY>$ 100 million</CURRENCY> plant in Woodridge , <LOCATION>Ill .</LOCATION>
, to make picture tubes for 32- and 35-inch screen TV sets .
The company currently buys the tubes from competitors .
The new plant , which is dependent on obtaining financing , will create about 280 new jobs , Zenith said .
The contract calls for production of the set-top boxes over five years .
Luehrs said manufacturing will begin and revenue will start to roll in during the first half of next year .
The boxes will be made on a build-to-order basis .
Zenith will convert its Chihuahua , <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> , analogue set-top box plant to manufacture the digital boxes .
Luehrs declined to say when the operation was expected to be profitable .
Americast will provide the boxes to subscribers as part of the service .
Its service is being introduced in selected markets across the <ORGANIZATION>United States</ORGANIZATION> .
Luehrs said digital technology in set-top boxes is only the beginning and said the technology will eventually show up in retail consumer electronics .
" We'll build a lot of these devices into television sets , for digital television , " he said . "
Although that is not where this particular contract is headed , the fact that there is a strong Zenith presence will pay us dividends in the future . "
Zenith has been plagued by generally soft conditions in the colour television industry , reporting full-year losses since 1989 .
Last month , it reported a second-quarter loss of <CURRENCY>$ 33.2 million</CURRENCY> , or 51 cents a share , vs. a loss of <CURRENCY>$ 45.3 million</CURRENCY> , or 97 cents a share , a year earlier .
Last November , <LOCATION>South Korea</LOCATION>-based <ORGANIZATION>LG Electronics Inc.</ORGANIZATION> bought a majority stake in Zenith .
<PERSON>Robert Gutenstein</PERSON> , an analyst for <ORGANIZATION>Kalf , Voorhis & Co .</ORGANIZATION>
, said the contract was " not unique , but it's big . "
" Digital is coming , it's economic and the question is what will make the consumer happy and at what price . "
