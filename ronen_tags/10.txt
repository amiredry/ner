JERUSALEM 1996-08-22
Israel's outgoing peace negotiator with <LOCATION>Syria</LOCATION> said on Thursday current tensions between the two countries appeared to be a storm in a teacup .
Itamar Rabinovich , who as Israel's ambassador to Washington conducted unfruitful negotiations with <LOCATION>Syria</LOCATION> , told <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> Radio it looked like Damascus wanted to talk rather than fight .
" It appears to me the Syrian priority is still to negotiate .
The Syrians are confused , they are definitely tense , but the general assessment here in Washington is that this is essentially a storm in a teacup , " he said .
Rabinovich is winding up his term as ambassador .
He will be replaced by <PERSON>Eliahu Ben-Elissar</PERSON> , a former Israeli envoy to Egypt and right-wing <ORGANIZATION>Likud</ORGANIZATION> party politician .
<LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> on Wednesday sent <LOCATION>Syria</LOCATION> a message , via Washington , saying it was committed to peace and wanted to open negotiations without preconditions .
But it slammed Damascus for creating what it called a dangerous atmosphere .
<LOCATION>Syria</LOCATION> accused <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> on Wednesday of launching a hysterical campaign against it after Israeli television reported that Damascus had recently test fired a missile .
It said its arms purchases were for defensive purposes .
" The message that we sent to ( Syrian President <PERSON>Hafez al- ) Assad</PERSON> is that Israel is ready at any time without preconditions to enter peace negotiations , " Israeli Foreign Minister <PERSON>David Levy</PERSON> told <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> Radio in an interview .
Tension has mounted since Israeli Prime Minister <PERSON>Benjamin Netanyahu</PERSON> took office in June vowing to retain the Golan Heights Israel captured from <LOCATION>Syria</LOCATION> in the 1967 Middle East war .
Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been deadlocked over the Golan since 1991 despite the previous government's willingness to make Golan concessions .
Peace talks between the two sides were last held in February .
" The voices coming out of Damascus are bad , not good .
The media ...
are full of expressions and declarations that must be worrying ...
this artificial atmosphere is very dangerous because those who spread it could become its prisoners , " Levy said .
" We expect from <LOCATION>Syria</LOCATION> , if its face is to peace , that it will answer Israel's message to enter peace negotiations because that is our goal , " he said . "
We do not want a war , God forbid .
No one benefits from wars . "
<LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION><ORGANIZATION>'s Channel Two</ORGANIZATION> television said Damascus had sent a " calming signal " to <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> .
It gave no source for the report .
Netanyahu and Levy's spokesmen said they could not confirm it .
The television also said that Netanyahu had sent messages to reassure <LOCATION>Syria</LOCATION> via Cairo , the United States and <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> .
