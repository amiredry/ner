Nepal's centre-right coalition government has offered to meet the country's hardline Maoist communists for talks in a bid to end an insurgency in <LOCATION>Nepal</LOCATION>'s western districts , officials said on Tuesday .
The Maoists oppose multi-party democracy and want to establish a communist state .
But the Nepali government said the insurgents must give up violence before it negotiates with them .
" They ( the insurgents ) should first give up their violent activities , " Home ( Interior ) Minister <PERSON>Khum Bahadur Khadga</PERSON> said .
About 54 people have died in Maoist insurgent activity and in police action against them since February , officials said .
Nepali opposition parties have accused the police of having killed more people than the insurgents .
Some human rights groups have criticised the government's handling of the situation .
In a speech in parliament on Tuesday , Khadga challenged the Maoist communists to " win the people's confidence " and win election to parliament .
On Monday , he had offered to talk to leaders of the <ORGANIZATION>United People's Front Nepal ( Bhattarai</ORGANIZATION> ) , the Maoist faction which leads the insurgency .
" The government is ready to guarantee security of the Maoist representatives who want to take part in peaceful dialogue , " <PERSON>Khadga</PERSON> said .
A multi-party democracy was set up in <LOCATION>Nepal</LOCATION> six years ago , after a popular movement by the centrist Nepali Congress party jointly with the <ORGANIZATION>Communist United Marxist-Leninist</ORGANIZATION> ( UML ) party .
The Nepali Congress leads the three-party coalition government while the UML is the main opposition party .
