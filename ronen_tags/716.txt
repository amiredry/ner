The Russian Trading System index of 21 issues fell 1.64 percent to 180.38 on volume of <CURRENCY>$ 4.38</CURRENCY> million .
" The market was extremely quiet today , some profit-taking locally , no Western orders , " said <PERSON>Nick Mokhoff</PERSON> , director of sales and trade at Alliance-Menatep . "
We are just a bit lower with a lot of inactivity during the whole day . "
Alexander Babayan , managing director at <ORGANIZATION>CentrInvest Securities</ORGANIZATION> , said the volume of orders was four to five times lower than a week ago .
As often , the most volume was in UES .
" Unified is one of the blue chips , which has more prospects than anybody else does , because they have ADRs supposedly coming up , " <PERSON>Mokhoff</PERSON> said .
UES officials said last week the board had not yet approved the final version of its application to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange</ORGANIZATION> Commission to issue ADRs .

Mokhoff said uncertainty about when Gazprom would issue ADRs and about whether shares from the Russian market could be converted into ADRs had hurt prices .
" Western investors ... will be investing in ADRs and I do not think people in Russia will be able to come up with the money for the underlying shares to drive the Russian shares to those levels , " <PERSON>Mokhoff</PERSON> said .
Gazprom has also tightened the rules restricting shareholers ' rights to trade its shares .
Mosenergo closed at at $ 0.958 after $ 0.966 , Rostelekom fell to <CURRENCY>$ 2.56</CURRENCY> from <CURRENCY>$ 2.58</CURRENCY> and LUKoil was <CURRENCY>$ 9.82</CURRENCY> after <CURRENCY>$ 9.85</CURRENCY> .
