The <ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION> said on Thursday it disagreed with German advice to consumers to shun British lamb until scientists determine whether mad cow disease can be transmitted to sheep .
<LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s representative to the <ORGANIZATION>European Union's veterinary committee</ORGANIZATION> <PERSON>Werner Zwingmann</PERSON> said on Wednesday consumers should buy sheepmeat from countries other than Britain until the scientific advice was clearer .
" We don't support any such recommendation because we don't see any grounds for it , " the <ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman Nikolaus van der Pas told a news briefing .
He said further scientific study was required and if it was found that action was needed it should be taken by the <ORGANIZATION>European Union</ORGANIZATION> .
He said a proposal last month by <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> Farm Commissioner <PERSON>Franz Fischler</PERSON> to ban sheep brains , spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains was a highly specific and precautionary move to protect human health .
Fischler proposed EU-wide measures after reports from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy ( BSE ) -- mad cow disease .
But <PERSON>Fischler</PERSON> agreed to review his proposal after the EU's standing veterinary committee , mational animal health officials , questioned if such action was justified as there was only a slight risk to human health .
Spanish Farm Minister <PERSON>Loyola de Palacio</PERSON> had earlier accused Fischler at an <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> farm ministers ' meeting of causing unjustified alarm through " dangerous generalisation . "
Only France and Britain backed Fischler's proposal .
The EU's scientific veterinary and multidisciplinary committees are due to re-examine the issue early next month and make recommendations to the senior veterinary officials .
Sheep have long been known to contract scrapie , a brain-wasting disease similar to BSE which is believed to have been transferred to cattle through feed containing animal waste .
British farmers denied on Thursday there was any danger to human health from their sheep , but expressed concern that German government advice to consumers to avoid British lamb might influence consumers across <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> .
" What we have to be extremely careful of is how other countries are going to take <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s lead , " Welsh National Farmers ' Union ( NFU ) chairman <PERSON>John Lloyd Jones</PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION>BBC</ORGANIZATION> radio .
<PERSON>Bonn</PERSON> has led efforts to protect public health after consumer confidence collapsed in March after a British report suggested humans could contract an illness similar to mad cow disease by eating contaminated beef .
Germany imported 47,600 sheep from Britain last year , nearly half of total imports .
It brought in 4,275 tonnes of British mutton , some 10 percent of overall imports .
