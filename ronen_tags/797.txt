Iraq has balked at the number of U.N. staff needed to implement the oil-for-food deal , blaming the United States for insisting on stringent monitoring .
In comments to reporters and a statement on Tuesday , Iraqi diplomats said the cost of the monitors and other staff , which <LOCATION>Baghdad</LOCATION> has to finance , surpasses funds allocated for electricity , water , sewers , education and agriculture .
At issue was a May 20 agreement allowing Iraq to sell <CURRENCY>$ 2 billion</CURRENCY> worth of oil to purchase badly needed food , medicine and other supplies to ease the impact of sanctions in force since its troops invaded <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION> in August 1990 .
The Iraqi statement said the United States was " interfering and pressing to augment the number of international staff and this is not legal and not justified . "
Iraq's deputy ambassador , <PERSON>Saeed Hasan</PERSON> , noted that the May 20 accord said that the number of personnel would be determined by the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> and that the government of Iraq would be consulted .
Saeed in his comments did not threaten to call off the deal and the <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> officials said they expected it to go into force next month after Secretary-General <PERSON>Boutros Boutros-Ghali</PERSON> reports that arrangements are in place .
The <ORGANIZATION>U.N. Department of Humanitarian Affairs</ORGANIZATION> ( DHA ) , which has to coordinate the distribution of food , medicine and other goods , increased the number of monitors earlier this month at the insistence of the <ORGANIZATION>United States</ORGANIZATION> .
According to <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> officials and diplomats , Iraq would have about <CURRENCY>$ 1.13</CURRENCY> billion to spend for food , medicine and other goods after monies for a reparations fund for Gulf War victims and costs for U.N. weapons inspections were deducted .
The cost of the <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> staff overseeing the distribution of food and other supplies was estimated to cost <CURRENCY>$ 31 million</CURRENCY> .
In addition another <CURRENCY>$ 12 million</CURRENCY> was anticipated to cover other expenses , such as oil experts and administrative costs .
For the distribution and supervision of humanitarian supplies the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> estimated it needed 1,190 people , including 267 international staff and 923 Iraqi support staff .
Of this number 64 foreign and 598 local staff would be in the northern Kurdish provinces , no longer the direct control of the <LOCATION>Baghdad</LOCATION> government .
Another 203 international staff and 325 Iraqis would run the programme in the central and southern parts of the country .
There are also 14 monitors to watch oil flows , 32 customs experts and four New York-based oil experts or overseers to approve contracts .
<PERSON>Yasushi Akashi</PERSON> , the DHA undersecretary-general , told the <ORGANIZATION>Security Council</ORGANIZATION> last week that the " financial requirements to support the ( humanitarian ) programme represent a very modest percentile of the total ...
roughly 3 percent . "
