It did not elaborate .
The Salang highway , <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION>'s main route to <LOCATION>Central Asia</LOCATION> , has been controlled by Dostum since he began fighting President <PERSON>Burhanuddin Rabbani</PERSON><ORGANIZATION>'s government in</ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION>Kabul</LOCATION> in January 1994 in alliance with <ORGANIZATION>Hezb-i-Islami party leader</ORGANIZATION> <PERSON>Gulbuddin Hekmatyar</PERSON> , then prime minister but rival to the president .
