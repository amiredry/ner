American <PERSON>Dennis Mitchell</PERSON> upstaged a trio of past and present Olympic 100 metres champions on Friday with a storming victory at the <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> grand prix .
Sporting his customary bright green outfit , the U.S. champion clocked 10.03 seconds despite damp conditions to take the scalp of <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s reigning Olympic champion Donovan Bailey , 1992 champion <PERSON>Linford Christie</PERSON> of Britain and American 1984 and 1988 champion Carl Lewis .
Mitchell also beat world and Olympic champion Bailey at the most lucrative meeting in the sport in Zurich last week .
The American , who finished fourth at the Atlanta Games , was fast out of his blocks and held off Bailey's late burst in the final 20 metres before heading off for a lap of celebration .
The Canadian was second in 10.09 with Lewis third in 10.10 , ahead of Atlanta bronze medallist Ato Boldon who clocked 10.12 in fourth .
Christie , competing in what is expected to be his last major international meeting , finished fifth in 10.14 .
Lewis , making a rare appearance in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> in a sprint race , left the track with a slight limp .
American Olympic high hurdles champion <PERSON>Allen Johnson</PERSON> defied the wet conditions to produce a brilliant 12.92 seconds in the 110 metres race , just 0.01 outside the world record held by Britain's <PERSON>Colin Jackson</PERSON> .
Johnson ran the same time at the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Olympic trials</ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION>in Atlanta</LOCATION> in June to become the second equal fastest hurdler of all time with American <PERSON>Roger Kingdom</PERSON> .
He seemed to relish the new track at the Brussels meeting , dominating the race from start to finish with a slight wind at his back .
Jackson , the only man to have run faster , could not live with his speed , taking second in 13.24 seconds .
The rain was pelting down when the women's high hurdlers stepped up for their 100 metres race .
But Sweden's Olympic high hurdles champion Ludmila Engquist , who crashed out of last week's meeting in Zurich after hitting a hurdle , also kept her footing perfectly to win in a fast 12.60 seconds .
Olympic silver medallist <PERSON>Brigita Bukovec</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Slovenia</LOCATION> could finish only fifth in the race in 12.95 .
Jamaican Commonwealth champion <PERSON>Michelle Freeman</PERSON> took second in 12.77 ahead of Cuban Aliuska Lopez .
The Zurich fall cost Engquist a shot at a jackpot of 20 one-kg gold bars which can be won by athletes who clinch their events at all of the <ORGANIZATION>Golden Four</ORGANIZATION> series in <LOCATION>Oslo</LOCATION> , Zurich , <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> .
Seven athletes went into Friday's penultimate meeting of the series with a chance of winning the prize and American men's 400 metres hurdles champion <PERSON>Derrick Adkins</PERSON> kept his hopes alive in the competition by winning his event in 47.93 .
American Olympic champion <PERSON>Gail Devers</PERSON> clocked a swift 10.84 seconds on her way to victory in the women's 100 metres , the second fastest time of the season and 0.10 seconds faster than her winning time in Atlanta .
Jamaican veteran Merlene Ottey , who beat <ORGANIZATION>Devers in</ORGANIZATION> Zurich after just missing out on the gold medal in Atlanta after a photo finish , had to settle for third place in 11.04 .
American world champion <PERSON>Gwen Torrence</PERSON> , the bronze medallist in Atlanta , was second in 11.00 .
It was a costly defeat for Ottey since it threw her out of the race for the <ORGANIZATION>Golden Four</ORGANIZATION> jackpot .
