LITTLE ROCK , Ark .
State and federal agents on Thursday sifted through the rubble of two predominantly black Arkansas churches that burned within minutes of one another late Tuesday and early Wednesday .
Both churches were in the Mississippi delta region of Arkansas , about 90 miles ( 145 kms ) southeast of <LOCATION>Little Rock</LOCATION> , and were located within three miles of one another .
" We're investigating with the idea that both fires may be arson , but that hasn't been conclusively established , " said Wayne Jordan , a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Arkansas State Police</ORGANIZATION> .
Agents of the F.B.I. and the <ORGANIZATION>Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms</ORGANIZATION> were also at the scene , <PERSON>Jordan</PERSON> said .
Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church and <LOCATION>St. Matthews Missionary Baptist Church</LOCATION> were both frame structures , each near Turner , Arkansas , a small community surrounded by cotton and soybean fields .
" This is rural Arkansas .
I'm surprised anyone could even find us out here , " said <PERSON>Fannie Johnson</PERSON> , a member of St. Matthew's , who said she believed arson was to blame .
Others connected with the two churches said they shared that suspicion , although all said they knew of no motive and no racial tension in the area .
" It's sad someone would have that kind of spite in their heart , " said Rev. Jerome Turner , pastor of <ORGANIZATION>Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church</ORGANIZATION> .
Arkansas has been spared the loss of predominantly black churches to arson , a wave that has claimed an estimated 30 houses of worship across the south in the past several months .
A black church near <LOCATION>Camden , Arkansas</LOCATION> , about 100 miles ( 161 kms ) south of <LOCATION>Little Rock</LOCATION> , burned in July , but federal agents have not determined the cause .
