The same pattern of the past few days persisted with futures declining early on the profit taking before firming late .
There was cash-related buying late from people who want to take delivery of the September contract , they said .
Cash sources noted that although the cash market is generally quiet , prices remain firm on demand for prompt delivery wood , they added .
Random Lengths quoted cash spruce at <CURRENCY>$ 419</CURRENCY> per tbf , up <CURRENCY>$ 5</CURRENCY> from last Friday and <CURRENCY>$ 7</CURRENCY> over the last midweek quote .
Reduced concern over Hurricane Edouard prompted some of the early profit taking .
