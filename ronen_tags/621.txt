At least one of the unidentified hijackers was apparently armed with grenades and TNT and threatened to blow the plane up in <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION> unless it was refuelled so they could fly to Britain to claim political asylum .
" They will surrender the passengers there and surrender themselves , " police spokesman <PERSON>Glafcos Xenos</PERSON> told reporters at <LOCATION>Cyprus's Larnaca airport</LOCATION> .
Security was tight at Stansted airport , which is about 30 miles ( 50 km ) northeast of the capital .
