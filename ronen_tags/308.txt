A small team of engineers from <ORGANIZATION>Sun Microsystems Inc.</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>JavaSoft</ORGANIZATION> unit said Sunday they have formed a new company , dubbed Internet Startup , to build Java infrastructure software .
The fledgling company , established in a ground-floor office here over the last two weeks , has received venture financing from Bessemer Venture Partners of <LOCATION>Menlo Park</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Calif .</LOCATION>.
David Cowan , Internet Startup founder and acting chief executive , is a general partner of Bessemer .
The startup company's acting chairman is Jim Bidzos , the president of RSA Data Security , a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Security Dynamics Technologies Inc.</ORGANIZATION> as well as chairman of <ORGANIZATION>VeriSign</ORGANIZATION> .
Internet Startup , which opened its doors with about half a dozen initial employees , combines experience at JavaSoft , <ORGANIZATION>Apple Computer Inc.</ORGANIZATION> , and <ORGANIZATION>Oracle Systems</ORGANIZATION> .
" Java portends dramatic changes in the way we use the Internet , " said <PERSON>Hong Bui</PERSON> , vice president of engineering of the new company after serving as a senior engineer at JavaSoft .
Java is a computer programming language introduced by <ORGANIZATION>Sun Microsystems</ORGANIZATION> in mid-1995 which has immediately captured the attention of the industry for its ability to operate across virtually all computer system in a relatively secure manner .

<PERSON>Prasad Wagle</PERSON> , another former senior JavaSoft engineer who is among the founding engineers at Internet Startup , said the new company aims to build software infrastructure using Java to make networked applications ubiquitious .
One feature of the Java language is that small software programmes , known as " applets " because they are small applications , can be downloaded from the server computers at the centre of networks onto individual computers for use .
In this model , individual computer users can always gain access to the latest programmes and do not need to store more software than they are currently using on their computers at any one time , also saving costs of memory and storage .
<PERSON>Chris Zuleeg</PERSON> , a veteran of Apple and a former JavaSoft marketing manager , is vice president of marketing at Internet Startup , whose Web site is www.internetstartup.com .
Bessemer has funded numerous Internet pioneers , including <ORGANIZATION>PSI Net</ORGANIZATION> , VeriSign and Individual .
