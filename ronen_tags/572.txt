SAO PAULO 1996-08-27
Brazil is likely to turn <LOCATION>Sao Paulo</LOCATION> state bank Banespa into a federal bank in a prior step to privatization , according to unnamed government sources , <PERSON>O Globo</PERSON> daily said .
The newspaper said the <LOCATION>Central Bank</LOCATION> special administration of Banespa ends in December 30 and after that the bank has to be liquidated or turned into a federal bank since there are no conditions to return Banespa to <LOCATION>Sao Paulo</LOCATION> state government .
A Central Bank spokesman said he could not confirm or deny the report .
Banespa has been under central bank special temporary administration since December 1994 .
The central bank management could be lifted if <LOCATION>Sao Paulo</LOCATION> state decided to take part in the recent federal government's plan to restructure state banks .
Under the plan , the federal government would provide 100 percent of the financing needed to restructure debt of state banks being privatized , liquidated or turned into development banks .
It also offers to refinance up to 50 percent of the debt held by state banks whose governments decide to keep control of their banks .
Although the plan was designed under terms proposed by <LOCATION>Sao Paulo</LOCATION> state governor <PERSON>Mario Covas</PERSON> , he has showed no interest in taking part in the plan because <LOCATION>Sao Paulo</LOCATION>'s debt with Banespa has increased sharply , <PERSON>O Globo</PERSON> said .
<LOCATION>Sao Paulo</LOCATION> state's debt is now estimated at 19 billion reais .
O Globo also said another delicate case to be solved involves private bank Bamerindus .
The newspaper said Bamerindus has sent to the Central Bank a proposal for restructuring combined with a request for a 90-day credit line , paying four percent a year plus the Basic Interest Rate of the <ORGANIZATION>Central Bank</ORGANIZATION> ( TBC ) .
O Globo also said the loan would give Bamerindus time to sell assets .
Bamerindus , <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s fourth-largest private bank , has been facing liquidity troubles .
Bamerindus declined to comment on negotiations being held with the <ORGANIZATION>Central Bank</ORGANIZATION> .
