U.S. envoy <PERSON>John Kornblum</PERSON> met Serbian President <PERSON>Slobodan Milosevic</PERSON> on Thursday in an effort to defuse a growing crisis surrounding <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION>'s post-war elections .
The American diplomat arrived in <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION> two days after international organisers postponed municipal elections in <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION> due to irregularities in the registration of Serb refugee voters .
" We discussed the decision to postpone the municipal elections and I made clear it was primarily the manipulation of voter registration by the Republika Srpska ( Bosnian Serb republic ) which led to this development , " <PERSON>Kornblum</PERSON> said after three hours of talks .
But he said the United States still believed it was important to go ahead with national elections in <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION> as scheduled on September 14 to bolster the peace process .
<PERSON>Kornblum</PERSON> gave no indication that he had won any specific commitment from Milosevic , the patron of the Bosnian Serbs , to rectify any abuses in the registration process .
Bosnia's Moslem political parties have urged their refugees to boycott the elections until irregularities with voter registration are resolved .
Human rights workers say Serbian and Bosnian Serb authorities coerced refugees to register only in Serb-held territory in Bosnia to solidify the results of wartime expulsions and military conquest .
Serbian officials have denied any abuses occurred during a 10-day registration period and the Bosnian Serbs , angry at the postponement of municipal elections , have threatened to hold local polls on their territory without the international community's blessing .
<PERSON>Kornblum</PERSON> said only elections endorsed by the <ORGANIZATION>Organisation for Security and Cooperation in</ORGANIZATION> Europe ( OSCE ) would be legitimate .
" As we have said publicly before , if there is any effort to do so ( hold local elections ) these elections will not be valid , " he said . "
The elections which are valid are those conducted by the international community under the management of the OSCE . "
After meeting Milosevic , Kornblum flew to the Croatian capital <LOCATION>Zagreb .</LOCATION>
He was due to head to the Bosnian town of Banja Luka on Friday to meet Bosnian Serb acting president Biljana Plavsic and Bosnian Serb opposition leaders .
He also planned to travel to Sarajevo to oversee the formal dissolution of the separatist Croat mini-state in western <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION> .
<ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> police , relief workers and <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> officers have reported a rise in political violence across <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION> in the run-up to the September 14 elections .
Voters will be choosing a three-member presidency and a parliament to rule over a loose union of <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION> , comprised of a Serb republic and a Moslem-Croat federation .
