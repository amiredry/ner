GOLF - PLAYERS DIVIDED ON CART REQUEST FOR OLAZABAL .
NORTHAMPTON , England 1996-08-27
Seve Ballesteros and <PERSON>Colin Montgomerie</PERSON> are divided on whether <PERSON>Jose Maria Olazabal</PERSON> should be allowed to return to the European PGA Tour using a motorised cart to transport him around the course .
The Spaniard has not played for nearly a year because of rheumatoid arthritis in both his feet , and organisers of a pairs event to be staged in <LOCATION>Bordeaux</LOCATION> , France from October 17 to 20 have been asked to provide him with a buggy .
" If the ( Tour's tournament ) committee decides to change the rule I would not be against it , " said Ballesteros , Olazabal's compatriot and Ryder Cup captain .
But commitee member Montgomerie said it could set an unhelpful precedent . "
I know Olly's situation is very unfortunate , but I don't think we can start giving dispensations , " he said . "
You've got to have a rule for everybody and I don't think it's feasible . "
The use of carts is generally prohibited in the professional game , and if Olazabal is allowed to use one in <LOCATION>Bordeaux</LOCATION> , he might then request one for the qualifying tournaments for next year's Ryder Cup .
