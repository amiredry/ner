Atletico came within a whisker of taking the Cup on the away-goal rule but squandered several chances after going 3-1 ahead 15 minutes from the end .
Juan Lopez gave Atletico the lead midway through the first half after <ORGANIZATION>Barcelona fullback</ORGANIZATION> <PERSON>Albert Ferrer</PERSON> and substitute goalkeeper Julen Lopetegui failed to clear a Milinko Pantic cross .
<ORGANIZATION>Barcelona's Hristo Stoichkov</ORGANIZATION> made his only significant contribution of the evening 10 minutes after halftime when <PERSON>Sergi Barjuan</PERSON> broke down the right to set up the fiery Bulgarian with a simple equaliser .
But Atletico struck back almost immediately through new signing <PERSON>Juan Eduardo Esnaider</PERSON> and then Serbian set-piece specialist Pantic made it 3-1 with a superb free-kick in the 75th minute .
Robson praised Atletico after the game , which was played in the Community of Madrid athletic stadium because of pitch problems at the Vicente Calderon ground .
The venue of Atletico's first league game , scheduled for Sunday , is still in doubt with the <ORGANIZATION>Real Madrid's Santiago</ORGANIZATION> Bernabeu a distinct possibility .
