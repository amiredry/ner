NEW YORK 1996-08-27
U.S. investors in troubled <ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's of London</ORGANIZATION> were considering late on Tuesday whether to appeal a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> court decision in favour of <PERSON>Lloyd</PERSON>'s and pledged to continue pursuing other legal actions .
A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday gave <PERSON>Lloyd</PERSON>'s a reprieve , throwing out an injunction that the insurance giant said could have led to its collapse .
A lower court issued the injunction on Friday and ordered <PERSON>Lloyd</PERSON>'s to give investors , known as Names , more information before requiring them to decide whether to accept a settlement offer as part of a reorganisation plan .
" My prediction is that the Names will appeal , " said <PERSON>Kenneth Chiate</PERSON> , a U.S. Name and a chief negotiator for the <ORGANIZATION>American Names Association</ORGANIZATION> .
" At this point , it is a sufficiently important decision that I'm confident that they will appeal , " he said . "
But to say that they definitely will would be premature until we determine what the exact basis for the court's ruling is . "
Under the reorganisation plan , <PERSON>Lloyd</PERSON>'s plans to reinsure its massive liabilities into a new company called <ORGANIZATION>Equitas</ORGANIZATION> .
The arrangement calls for investors to make additional payments to fund Equitas but also provides them with 3.2 billion stg in compensation to help reduce their prior outstanding liabilities .
The Names had been scheduled to decide whether to accept or reject the offer by 1100 GMT Wednesday , but <PERSON>Lloyd</PERSON>'s chairman <PERSON>David Rowland</PERSON> said on Tuesday the offer would be extended .
At least eight U.S. states have still some form of litigation pending , said <PERSON>John Head</PERSON> , spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Association of Lloyd's State</ORGANIZATION> Chairmen , a group representing U.S. Names .
" It goes without saying that we're rather disappointed , " Head said of the decision by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit , sitting in</ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION>Baltimore .</LOCATION>
But , he said , " we still have hope that somebody is going to see our point of view in this . "
The <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> attorney general told <PERSON>Lloyd</PERSON>'s last week it was considering a new legal action against the British insurance market , based on allegations of consumer fraud .
" We have notified them of our concerns and asked them to give us a response , " said <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> attorney general <PERSON>Gale Norton</PERSON> .
Norton said she was concerned that the <PERSON>Lloyd</PERSON>'s agreement immunizes it from future litigation regarding Equitas and requires that all legal actions be heard outside of <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> .
In addition , she said she was concerned the plan may not offer investors enough protection from additional , future liabilities .
Meanwhile , an appeal of a lawsuit filed by some 600 Names in California is still pending before the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit , Chiate of the American Names Association</ORGANIZATION> said .
That lawsuit , which seeks rescision and restitution , was dismissed in a <ORGANIZATION>U.S. district court</ORGANIZATION> .
That case " is what I call the most significant alternate remedy for us , " Chiate said .
The individual Names , however , now must decide whether to accept <PERSON>Lloyd</PERSON>'s settlement offer or reject the offer and pursue litigation .
Chiate said he has advised Names that " they must make , individually , a risk benefit analysis . "
Rejection involved forfeiting the compensation offer and risking the possibility of owing <PERSON>Lloyd</PERSON>'s two to three times more than <PERSON>Lloyd</PERSON>'s is now willing to accept , he said .
But , in rejecting the offer , the Names would retain their rights to pursue litigation , he said .
