" Paul accepted the situation .
He hasn't played any first-team games for Villa this season and he's not the type of player I would have brought on as a substitute , " <PERSON>McCarthy</PERSON> said . "
But he surprised me in training over the last two days because of his involvement .
He's certainly is still very much part of my plans for the future .
" At 24 , 25 or 26 you could get away with it , not having played first-team games .
But at 36 it would be asking too much of Paul , " he said .
