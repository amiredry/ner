A new U.N. relief coordinator has arrived in <LOCATION>Baghdad</LOCATION> to take up the task of organising humanitarian goods distribution and to face Iraq's continuing opposition over the number of international monitors to be involved .
<ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> and diplomatic sources said on Tuesday that Secretary- General <PERSON>Boutros Boutros-Ghali</PERSON> had appointed Italian Gualtiero Fulcheri and sent him to Iraq last week to replace <PERSON>Moroccan Mohamed Zejjari</PERSON> .
One diplomat said Iraq and <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> were still in disagreement on how many international observers would be required to ascertain the equitable distribution of humanitarian supplies that will be procured under <LOCATION>Baghdad</LOCATION>'s oil deal with <ORGANIZATION>U.N .</ORGANIZATION>
" The <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> would like to employ hundreds of foreign monitors .
Baghdad says it can only accept a few dozens , " said the diplomat .
<LOCATION>Baghdad</LOCATION> holds that the Iraq-U.N. memorandum of understanding on partial oil sales signed last June does not specify how many foreign observers should be stationed in Iraq .
" Observation of food supplies and their distribution are still a major issue and seems the two sides have not yet filled the gap separating them , " said another diplomat .
Iraq's partial oil sales pact with U.N. , allowing crude exports worth <CURRENCY>$ 2 billion</CURRENCY> every six months , gives U.N. the right to supervise the purchase and distribution of food supplies in the country .
The deal is a humanitarian exception to the <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> sanctions imposed on Iraq for invading Kuwait in 1990 which include a ban on its oil exports .
Fulcheri declined comment on the differences between the <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> and Iraq , saying only : " There are several different things which still need to be done . "
Fulcheri started his U.N. career in 1960 and has long experience in U.N. emergency relief in Congo , <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>, Sudan and Somalia</ORGANIZATION> .
