Media baron <PERSON>Rupert Murdoch</PERSON><ORGANIZATION>'s News Corp Ltd</ORGANIZATION> reported lower than expected 1995/96 profits on Thursday , but forecast that the hit film " <PRODUCT>Independence Day</PRODUCT> " would help increase profits by at least 20 percent in 1996/97 .
" From an earnings perspective , the current fiscal year has begun with great promise due to the hit motion picture ' Independence Day , ' " News Corp said in a statement announcing its results for the year to June 30 , 1996 .
It said moderating paper prices and solid orders for advertising at its <ORGANIZATION>Fox Broadcasting</ORGANIZATION> television network in the United States would also help boost profits in the 1996/97 year . "
A budgeted profit increase of at least 20 percent for the full year currently appears very attainable , " News Corp said .
The bullish comments for the coming year soothed analysts and most shareholders , who were disappointed by the lower than expected profit for 1995/96 .
News announced pre-abnormals net profit for the year fell six percent to <CURRENCY>A$ 1.26 billion</CURRENCY> ( <CURRENCY>US$ 995 million</CURRENCY> ) and earnings per share dropped to 40 cents from 46 cents .
Analysts had on average expected a pre-abnormals profit of A$ 1.343 billion .
" The year just gone was disappointing , but the outlook for the current year looks good , " First Pacific media analyst <PERSON>Lachlan Drummond</PERSON> said .
News Corp said strong performances in U.S. television and British newspapers were offset by lower profits from <ORGANIZATION>News Corp</ORGANIZATION>'s magazine and publishing divisions and further hefty losses from its Asian Star TV operations .
Higher newsprint prices hit profits hard . "
Throughout the group , higher paper prices increased costs by over <CURRENCY>US$ 300 million</CURRENCY> , " it said .
<ORGANIZATION>News Corp</ORGANIZATION> said British newspaper operating profits rose 10 percent for the year , as higher cover prices at <ORGANIZATION>The Sun and The Times</ORGANIZATION> and higher advertising volumes offset increased newsprint costs .
Advertising revenues at <ORGANIZATION>The Times</ORGANIZATION> grew 20 percent .
Analysts said sharply lower earnings from <ORGANIZATION>News Corp</ORGANIZATION>'s book publishing division and its U.S. magazines had been the major surprises in the results for 1995/96 .
News Corp said revenue gains at its magazines and inserts division were offset by higher paper prices and lower sales at the U.S. TV Guide .
News said dramatically lower earnings from the British arm of its Harper-Collins publishing division more than offset healthy results from its U.S. operation .
It said the demise of the Net Book Agreement had hurt the British operations , and weak performances from the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> unit of <LOCATION>Harper-Collins</LOCATION> had not helped .
The minimum price setting expired last September when three publishers pulled out .
But it was the bullish profit forecast for 1996/97 that took the spotlight in the market , with some analysts saying 20 percent may even be an understatement .
" If they're saying at least 20 percent , then their internal forecasts are probably saying 25 or 30 percent , " said one Sydney media analyst who declined to be named .
<ORGANIZATION>News Corp</ORGANIZATION>'s shares were down eight cents at <CURRENCY>A$ 6.39</CURRENCY> at 2.00 p.m. ( 0400 GMT ) in a soft market .
( A<CURRENCY>$ 1</CURRENCY> = <CURRENCY>US$ 0.79</CURRENCY> )
