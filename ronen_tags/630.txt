BEIJING 1996-08-27
China has publicly thanked Gabon for its strong support at the United Nations Human Rights Commission , where <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> has come under attack from Western nations for its human rights record .
China's President <PERSON>Jiang Zemin</PERSON> offered his gratitude in a meeting on Monday with visiting Gabon President <PERSON>Omar Bongo</PERSON> , the official Xinhua news agency said .
<PERSON>Jiang</PERSON> also acknowledged the Central African nation's support for China's stance on Taiwan , which <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> views as a renegade province , while Bongo was quoted as thanking China for economic and technological aid , the agency said late on Monday .
In April , China quashed a draft resolution by the <ORGANIZATION>U.N. Human Rights Commission</ORGANIZATION> expressing concern over continuing reports of <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION>'s violations of fundamental freedoms .
After the defeat of the resolution , drafted by the <ORGANIZATION>European Union and the United States , China's Foreign Ministry</ORGANIZATION> thanked 26 countries for backing its motion for " no action " on the document .
It was the sixth year in a row that China avoided censure at the <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION>'s main human rights forum .
China has been accused of a wide range of human rights abuses , often in violation of its own legal code , in an effort to silence dissent .
