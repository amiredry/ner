KANSAS CITY , Mo .
Above-normal summer rainfall in the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <PERSON>High Plains</PERSON> has produced near-ideal conditions for planting the 1997 hard red winter wheat crop , analysts said Wednesday .
From central Texas north to <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> , rains throughout July and August have relieved most of the drought conditions that plagued the region earlier this year .
" Our moisture situation is excellent , especially for fall planting of winter wheat , " said <PERSON>Kim Anderson</PERSON> , extension wheat marketing economist at <ORGANIZATION>Oklahoma State University</ORGANIZATION> .
The irony of the above-average summer rainfall was not lost on High Plains wheat producers , who only three months ago were caught in a drought so severe that old-timers likened conditions to the " Dust Bowl " days of the 1930s .
" It's definitely a turnabout from this past year , but you know last year we had pretty good moisture about this time of year , and then about October 1 it quit , " said <PERSON>Mark Hodges</PERSON> , executive director of the Oklahoma Wheat Commission . "
Hopefully that's not going to happen this year . "
According to figures released by the Oklahoma Climatological Survey , an average of 20.19 inches fell across the state between March 1 and August 26 , 1996 .
That's about 1/2 inch above the average for the same time period , according to <PERSON>Howard Johnson</PERSON> , associate state climatologist at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Oklahoma</ORGANIZATION> .
He noted that the majority of that 20.19 inches had fallen since July .
As an example of just how dry it was , data showed that between October 1 , 1995 and March 1 , 1996 , the state received an average of only 4.6 inches of rainfall .
In northern Texas , the current rainfall situation was similar to most of <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> , said <PERSON>Rodney Mosier</PERSON> , executive assistant for the <ORGANIZATION>Texas Wheat Producers</ORGANIZATION> .
" Up here in the Texas Panhandle , we've had some extremely beneficial rains that came through within the last several days and are really setting us up for ideal conditions for planting wheat , " <PERSON>Mosier</PERSON> said .
But he warned that the situation was not as ideal in central and <LOCATION>southern Texas</LOCATION> , where mositure levels were still short despite the rains brought by Hurricane Dolly last week .
In Kansas , typically the number one U.S. hard red winter wheat producer , topsoil moisture levels were rated mostly adequate during the week ended Sunday , according to the state's agricultural statistics service .
In its weekly report released Monday , the service said Kansas topsoil moisture was rated eight percent surplus , 77 percent adequate and 15 percent short to very short .
<ORGANIZATION>Oklahoma's Agricultural Statistics Service</ORGANIZATION> showed similar conditions , rating topsoil moisture levels as seven percent surplus , 81 percent adequate and 12 percent short to very short .
Data on topsoil moisture ratings were not released by the <ORGANIZATION>Texas Agricultural Statistics Service</ORGANIZATION> .
