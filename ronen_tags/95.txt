Palestinians accuse PA of banning books .
NABLUS , West Bank 1996-08-22
A <LOCATION>West Bank</LOCATION> bookseller charged on Thursday that the <ORGANIZATION>Palestinian Information Ministry</ORGANIZATION> has forced him to sign an undertaking not to distribute books written by critics of Israeli-PLO self-rule deals .
" They made me sign an undertaking not to sell the books to anyone at the risk of legal action .
One official told me ' you have to either destroy the books or return them to Amman ' , " <PERSON>Daoud Makkawi</PERSON> , owner of the <LOCATION>Nablus</LOCATION>-based <ORGANIZATION>al-Risala</ORGANIZATION> bookshop , told <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION> .
He said ministry officials made him sign this a few weeks ago after he brought about a dozen copies from Jordan of a book by <PERSON>Edward</PERSON> Said , a prominent scholar at New York City's Columbia University .
Said , a U.S. citizen of Palestinian origin , has been an outspoken critic of the 1993 Israeli-PLO self-rule deal and has written at least two books on the accord .
On Wednesday a bookseller in the West Bank town of Ramallah said police about a month ago confiscated several copies of two of Said's books on the Israel-PLO self-rule deals .
Palestinian Information Ministry Director-General Mutawakel Taha denied that ministry officials forced anyone to sign any undertaking and insisted that the <ORGANIZATION>Palestinian Authority</ORGANIZATION> has no plans to censor books .
" There is no strategy to ban books or to suppress freedom of expression in any form whatsoever , " Taha told <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION> .
But Taha said that the absence of relevent legislations may have resulted in some mistakes by some security officials .
" This may explain some mistakes against some journalists and writers , " he said .
Daoud said books by other authors , including British Journalist <PERSON>Patrick Seale</PERSON> , were also banned .
He said that security officials often visit his shop to make sure he was not selling the books .
" I think this is a bad beginning .
If we have confidence , why should we be afraid of the other opinion ? "
<PERSON>Daoud</PERSON> said .
Thousands of books were banned from sale in the West Bank and <LOCATION>Gaza</LOCATION> Strip by the Israeli military authorities before the Jewish state handed over parts of the two areas to the PLO under a self-rule deal in 1994 .
