The CRP said the four were arrested on Monday night at the northeastern Tafawa Balewa University .
The main academic union , ASUU , along with two smaller university unions , was banned by <LOCATION>Nigeria</LOCATION>'s military government last week , because of a four-month strike by teachers for better working conditions .

Dozens of people opposed to the government are in detention .
Commonwealth foreign ministers are to meet in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> on Wednesday to discuss what action to take , after a visit to <LOCATION>Nigeria</LOCATION> was called off when the government imposed strict rules on whom the mission would be allowed to see .
