MIAMI 1996-08-23
The U.S. and Colombian governments reached an agreement that will allow <ORGANIZATION>AMR Corp's American Airlines</ORGANIZATION> to operate three round-trip flights between <LOCATION>New York and Bogota</LOCATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Transportation</ORGANIZATION> said Friday .
Under the agreement , which followed talks in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> this week , AMR also will be allowed to shift up to four of the weekly flights it now operates between <LOCATION>Miami and Colombia</LOCATION> to its <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> gateway .
The United States also will be able to designate one new all-cargo carrier for service between the two nations after two years .
Colombia was permitted to add a single additional round-trip flight to its current New York service , although it will not be able to do so while under Category Two ( Conditional ) status under the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Aviation Administration's International Aviation Safety</ORGANIZATION> program .
Colombia would be allowed to add new service when its safety assessment has been improved , the department said .
With the exception of the new services just agreed to , the governments of the two nations have agreed to maintain their current level of routes and airlines for the next 2-1/2 years , the agreement said .
The agreement resolved a dispute that arose in June when <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> turned down American's request to operate flights between <LOCATION>New York and Bogota</LOCATION> , a denial that prompted the United States to charge that the Colombians were breaking a bilateral aviation agreement and to propose sanctions against one of two Colombian airlines , Avianca and ACES .
