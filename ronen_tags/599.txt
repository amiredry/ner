Afghan government military chief <PERSON>Ahmad Shah Masood</PERSON> briefed visiting <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <PERSON>Congressman Dana Rohrabacher</PERSON> on Tuesday on a peace plan for his wartorn country .
A spokesman for Masood said he had told the California Republican at a meeting in northern Kabul that President <PERSON>Burhanuddin Rabbani</PERSON>'s government favoured talks with all Afghan factions to set up an interim government .
The factions should agree to appoint a transitional leader , draft a new constitution , collect heavy weapons , create a national army and hold free elections in which the transitional leader would be barred from standing , he added .
Rohrabacher flew into Bagram military airbase north of <LOCATION>Kabul</LOCATION> in a <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> plane on Tuesday after meeting northern opposition militia leader General Abdul Rashid Dostum .
Masood's spokesman Amrollah ( one name ) said <PERSON>Rohrabacher</PERSON> had recently visited Italy , <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> as part of a mission to promote peace in Afghanistan .
" We are certainly serious more than before to find a solution to the Afghan problem and support every <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> plan , " Amrollah quoted Rohrabacher as saying .
However , a spokesman for Prime Minister <PERSON>Gulbuddin Hekmatyar</PERSON> , a long-time rival of Masood , expressed concern at signs of renewed U.S. interest in Afghanistan .
" America wants to block the establishment of a strong Islamic government in Afghanistan and the U.S. intends to neutralise the Afghan peace process initiated by the Afghans themselves , " said the spokesman , <PERSON>Hamid Ibrahimi</PERSON> .
" A great game has been started in Afghanistan as America feels that Tehran and <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> have got stronger in the Afghan picture -- something Washington wants to change , " he said .
Rohrabacher was expected to visit neutral faction leaders in the eastern city of Jalalabad and meet leaders of the rebel Islamic Taleban militia in the southern city of Kandahar .
Afghan guerrilla factions have been locked in a bloody power struggle since the fall of the communist government in April 1992 .
Hekmatyar , once <PERSON>Rabbani</PERSON>'s main rival , made a peace pact with him and rejoined the government as prime minister in June .
