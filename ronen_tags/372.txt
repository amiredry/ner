Most of the test 15 who beat the Springboks 33-26 to secure New Zealand's first-ever rugby series in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> stood in the middle of the empty 50,000-seat Loftus Versfeld .
Magnificent , ' ' said Fitzpatrick , <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>'s most capped player and the world's most capped forward .
The players relived the moves and tries , the tackles and what might have been as the emotions of victory continued .
Zinzan Brooke , the only No 8 in test rugby to have scored a dropped goal when he kicked a three-pointer against England during last year's World Cup , added a second to his name yesterday .
I was right here , ' ' he said standing at the spot where he had received the ball for the kick .
The maul was there and I was going to go in but I thought I should hold off because we had the ball .
When ( halfback ) <PERSON>Justin Marshall</PERSON> got the ball he was going to go on the openside where <PERSON>Jon Preston</PERSON> was so I emptied my lung at him to get the ball this way .
I just hit through and I was punching the air before the ball got there .
It cost me a few bucks at the bar . '
The decision to attempt a dropped goal was a spontaneous one , <PERSON>Brooke</PERSON> said .
It was just like the World Cup , the ball came and the chance was there . '
Centre <PERSON>Frank Bunce</PERSON> said he had never felt so exhausted during a match .
We were gutted and there was nowhere to hide , they just kept coming at you , ' ' he said .
I was gone in the first 20 minutes , completely exhausted , but you had no choice .
There was just so much riding on it .
It's amazing just how big this ground was yesterday . '
Two-try winger Jeff Wilson said he was so tired that he kept asking Bunce where he should be while defending .
He told me I'm buggered too so just hang in there ' , ' ' Wilson recalled .
About 4000 New Zealander supporters were partying into the early hours of today in the South African capital .
Messages of goodwill continued to roll into the team hotel .
