<S><ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> rejects German call to boycott British lamb .</S>
<S><PERSON>Peter Blackburn</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>BRUSSELS</LOCATION> 1996-08-22</S>
<S>The <ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION> said on Thursday it disagreed with German advice to consumers to shun British lamb until scientists determine whether mad cow disease can be transmitted to sheep .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s representative to the <ORGANIZATION>European Union</ORGANIZATION>'s veterinary committee <PERSON>Werner Zwingmann</PERSON> said on Wednesday consumers should buy sheepmeat from countries other than <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> until the scientific advice was clearer .</S>
<S>" We don't support any such recommendation because we don't see any grounds for it , " the <ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman <PERSON>Nikolaus van der Pas</PERSON> told a news briefing .</S>
<S>He said further scientific study was required and if it was found that action was needed it should be taken by the <ORGANIZATION>European Union</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>He said a proposal last month by <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> Farm Commissioner <PERSON>Franz Fischler</PERSON> to ban sheep brains , spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains was a highly specific and precautionary move to protect human health .</S>
<S><PERSON>Fischler</PERSON> proposed EU-wide measures after reports from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy ( BSE ) -- mad cow disease .</S>
<S>But <PERSON>Fischler</PERSON> agreed to review his proposal after the <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION>'s standing veterinary committee , mational animal health officials , questioned if such action was justified as there was only a slight risk to human health .</S>
<S>Spanish Farm Minister <PERSON>Loyola de Palacio</PERSON> had earlier accused <PERSON>Fischler</PERSON> at an <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> farm ministers ' meeting of causing unjustified alarm through " dangerous generalisation . "</S>
<S>Only <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> backed <PERSON>Fischler</PERSON>'s proposal .</S>
<S>The <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION>'s scientific veterinary and multidisciplinary committees are due to re-examine the issue early next month and make recommendations to the senior veterinary officials .</S>
<S>Sheep have long been known to contract scrapie , a brain-wasting disease similar to BSE which is believed to have been transferred to cattle through feed containing animal waste .</S>
<S>British farmers denied on Thursday there was any danger to human health from their sheep , but expressed concern that German government advice to consumers to avoid British lamb might influence consumers across <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>" What we have to be extremely careful of is how other countries are going to take <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s lead , " <ORGANIZATION>Welsh National Farmers ' Union</ORGANIZATION> ( <ORGANIZATION>NFU</ORGANIZATION> ) chairman <PERSON>John Lloyd Jones</PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION>BBC radio</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> has led efforts to protect public health after consumer confidence collapsed in March after a British report suggested humans could contract an illness similar to mad cow disease by eating contaminated beef .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> imported 47,600 sheep from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> last year , nearly half of total imports .</S>
<S>It brought in 4,275 tonnes of British mutton , some 10 percent of overall imports .</S>

<S><LOCATION>JERUSALEM</LOCATION> 1996-08-22</S>
<S><LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>'s outgoing peace negotiator with <LOCATION>Syria</LOCATION> said on Thursday current tensions between the two countries appeared to be a storm in a teacup .</S>
<S><PERSON>Itamar Rabinovich</PERSON> , who as <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> conducted unfruitful negotiations with <LOCATION>Syria</LOCATION> , told <ORGANIZATION>Israel Radio</ORGANIZATION> it looked like <LOCATION>Damascus</LOCATION> wanted to talk rather than fight .</S>
<S>" It appears to me the Syrian priority is still to negotiate .</S>
<S>The Syrians are confused , they are definitely tense , but the general assessment here in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> is that this is essentially a storm in a teacup , " he said .</S>
<S><PERSON>Rabinovich</PERSON> is winding up his term as ambassador .</S>
<S>He will be replaced by <PERSON>Eliahu Ben-Elissar</PERSON> , a former Israeli envoy to <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> and right-wing <ORGANIZATION>Likud</ORGANIZATION> party politician .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> on Wednesday sent <LOCATION>Syria</LOCATION> a message , via <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> , saying it was committed to peace and wanted to open negotiations without preconditions .</S>
<S>But it slammed <LOCATION>Damascus</LOCATION> for creating what it called a dangerous atmosphere .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Syria</LOCATION> accused <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> on Wednesday of launching a hysterical campaign against it after Israeli television reported that <LOCATION>Damascus</LOCATION> had recently test fired a missile .</S>
<S>It said its arms purchases were for defensive purposes .</S>
<S>" The message that we sent to ( Syrian President <PERSON>Hafez al-</PERSON> ) <PERSON>Assad</PERSON> is that <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> is ready at any time without preconditions to enter peace negotiations , " Israeli Foreign Minister <PERSON>David Levy</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>Israel Radio</ORGANIZATION> in an interview .</S>
<S>Tension has mounted since Israeli Prime Minister <PERSON>Benjamin Netanyahu</PERSON> took office in June vowing to retain the <LOCATION>Golan Heights Israel</LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION>Syria</LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> war .</S>
<S>Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been deadlocked over the <LOCATION>Golan</LOCATION> since 1991 despite the previous government's willingness to make <LOCATION>Golan</LOCATION> concessions .</S>
<S>Peace talks between the two sides were last held in February .</S>
<S>" The voices coming out of <LOCATION>Damascus</LOCATION> are bad , not good .</S>
<S>The media ...</S>
<S>are full of expressions and declarations that must be worrying ...</S>
<S>this artificial atmosphere is very dangerous because those who spread it could become its prisoners , " <PERSON>Levy</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>" We expect from <LOCATION>Syria</LOCATION> , if its face is to peace , that it will answer <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>'s message to enter peace negotiations because that is our goal , " he said . "</S>
<S>We do not want a war , <PERSON>God</PERSON> forbid .</S>
<S>No one benefits from wars . "</S>
<S><LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Channel Two</ORGANIZATION> television said <LOCATION>Damascus</LOCATION> had sent a " calming signal " to <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>It gave no source for the report .</S>

<S>Three Afghan guards brought to the <LOCATION>United Arab Emirates</LOCATION> last week by Russian hostages who escaped from the Taleban militia will return to <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> in a few days , the Afghan embassy in <LOCATION>Abu Dhabi</LOCATION> said on Thursday .</S>
<S>" Our ambassador is in touch with the <LOCATION>UAE</LOCATION> foreign ministry .</S>
<S>Their return to <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> will take place in two or three days , " an embassy official said .</S>
<S>" The embassy is issuing them travel documents for their return to their homeland .</S>
<S>There is no objection to their travel , " he added .</S>
<S>The three Islamic Taleban guards were overpowered by seven Russian aircrew who escaped to <LOCATION>UAE</LOCATION> state <LOCATION>Sharjah</LOCATION> last Friday on board their own aircraft after a year in the captivity of Taleban militia in <LOCATION>Kandahar</LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>The <LOCATION>UAE</LOCATION> said on Monday it would hand over the three to the <ORGANIZATION>International Red Crescent</ORGANIZATION> , possibly last Tuesday .</S>
<S>It has since been silent on the issue .</S>
<S>When asked whether the three guards would travel back to <LOCATION>Kandahar</LOCATION> or the Afghan capital <LOCATION>Kabul</LOCATION> , the embassy official said : " That has not been decided , but possibly <LOCATION>Kandahar</LOCATION> . "</S>
<S><LOCATION>Kandahar</LOCATION> is the headquarters of the opposition Taleban militia .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Kabul</LOCATION> is controlled by President <PERSON>Burhanuddin Rabbani</PERSON>'s government , which Taleban is fighting to overthrow .</S>
<S>The embassy official said the three men , believed to be in their 20s , were currently in <LOCATION>Abu Dhabi</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>He did not elaborate .</S>
<S>The Russians , working for the <ORGANIZATION>Aerostan</ORGANIZATION> firm in the Russian republic of <LOCATION>Tatarstan</LOCATION> , were taken hostage after a Taleban MiG-19 fighter forced their cargo plane to land in August 1995 .</S>
<S>Taleban said its shipment of ammunition from <LOCATION>Albania</LOCATION> was evidence of Russian military support for <PERSON>Rabbani</PERSON>'s government .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> said the crew's nationality was coincidental .</S>
<S>Numerous diplomatic attempts to free the seven failed .</S>
<S>The Russians , who said they overpowered the guards -- two armed with Kalashnikov automatic rifles -- while doing regular maintenance work on their Ilyushin 76 cargo plane last Friday , left the <LOCATION>UAE</LOCATION> capital <LOCATION>Abu Dhabi</LOCATION> for home on Sunday .</S>

<S>German farm ministry tells consumers to avoid British mutton .</S>
<S><LOCATION>BONN</LOCATION> 1996-08-22</S>
<S><LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Ministry</ORGANIZATION> suggested on Wednesday that consumers avoid eating meat from British sheep until scientists determine whether mad cow disease can be transmitted to the animals .</S>
<S>" Until this is cleared up by the <ORGANIZATION>European Union</ORGANIZATION>'s scientific panels -- and we have asked this to be done as quickly as possible -- ( consumers ) should if at all possible give preference to sheepmeat from other countries , " ministry official <PERSON>Werner Zwingmann</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>ZDF</ORGANIZATION> television .</S>
<S>" I do not want to say that there is a concrete danger for consumers , " he added . "</S>
<S>There are too many holes in what we know , and these must be filled very quickly . "</S>
<S><LOCATION>Bonn</LOCATION> has led efforts to ensure consumer protection tops the list of priorities in dealing with the mad cow crisis , which erupted in March when <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> acknowledged humans could contract a similar illness by eating contaminated beef .</S>
<S>The <ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION> agreed this month to rethink a proposal to ban the use of suspect sheep tissue after some <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> veterinary experts questioned whether it was justified .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> Farm Commissioner <PERSON>Franz Fischler</PERSON> had proposed banning sheep brains , spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains after reports from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy ( BSE ) -- mad cow disease .</S>
<S>But some members of the <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION>'s standing veterinary committee questioned whether the action was necessary given the slight risk to human health .</S>
<S>The question is being studied separately by two <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> scientific committees .</S>
<S>Sheep have long been known to contract scrapie , a similar brain-wasting disease to BSE which is believed to have been transferred to cattle through feed containing animal waste .</S>
<S>British officials say sheep meat is perfectly safe to eat .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>ZDF</ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> imported 47,600 sheep from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> last year , nearly half of total imports .</S>
<S>It brought in 4,275 tonnes of British mutton , some 10 percent of overall imports .</S>
<S>After the British government admitted a possible link between mad cow disease and its fatal human equivalent , the <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> imposed a worldwide ban on British beef exports .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> leaders agreed at a summit in June to a progressive lifting of the ban as <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> takes parallel measures to eradicate the disease .</S>

<S>Garlic pills may not lower blood cholesterol and studies that show they do may be flawed , British researchers have reported .</S>
<S>A study by a team of doctors at <ORGANIZATION>Oxford University</ORGANIZATION> has found people with high blood cholesterol do not benefit significantly from taking garlic tablets .</S>
<S>The study involved 115 people with high blood cholesterol levels .</S>
<S>They were given 900 milligrams a day of dried garlic powder or placebo tablets . "</S>
<S>There were no significant differences between the groups receiving garlic and placebo , " they wrote in the <ORGANIZATION>Journal of the Royal College of Physicians</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>Those taking part were told to eat a low-fat diet for six weeks before they started taking the pills , and their blood cholesterol measured before and after the six-week period .</S>
<S>The researchers said this would make their findings more accurate .</S>
<S>Several studies have found garlic pills can lower blood pressure and blood cholesterol .</S>
<S>But the <LOCATION>Oxford</LOCATION> team disputed these findings and said either previous trials may have been interpreted incorrectly , those taking part were not given special diets beforehand or the duration of the studies may have been too short .</S>
<S>The six-month trial was funded by the <ORGANIZATION>British Heart Foundation</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Lichtwer Pharma GmbH</ORGANIZATION> , which makes Kwai brand garlic tablets .</S>

<S>Tennis - <PERSON>Philippoussis</PERSON> looms for <PERSON>Sampras</PERSON> in U.S. Open .</S>

<S><LOCATION>NEW YORK</LOCATION> 1996-08-22</S>
<S>World number one <PERSON>Pete Sampras</PERSON> , seeking his first Grand Slam title of the year , and women's top seed <PERSON>Steffi Graf</PERSON> , aiming for her third , should be able to ease into the year's final major , which begins on Monday .</S>
<S><PERSON>Sampras</PERSON> opens the defence of his U.S. Open crown against <PERSON>David Rikl</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>Czech Republic</LOCATION> , while top-ranked <PERSON>Graf</PERSON> begins her title defence against <PERSON>Yayuk Basuki</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Indonesia</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>Wednesday's U.S. Open draw ceremony revealed that both title holders should run into their first serious opposition in the third round .</S>
<S>Looming in <PERSON>Sampras</PERSON>'s future is a likely third-round date with recent nemesis <PERSON>Mark Philippoussis</PERSON> , the rising Australian who took out <PERSON>Sampras</PERSON> in the third round of the Australian Open in January .</S>
<S><PERSON>Sampras</PERSON> avenged that defeat with a straight sets win over the 19-year-old power hitter in the second round at <LOCATION>Wimbledon</LOCATION> and their rubber match in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> could provide some first-week fireworks .</S>
<S>While only a stunning upset will keep <PERSON>Graf</PERSON> from sailing through to a predictable semifinal showdown with third seed <PERSON>Arantxa Sanchez Vicario</PERSON> , the German star could also be tested in the third round where she will probably face 28th-ranked veteran <PERSON>Natasha Zvereva</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Belarus</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>There will be no repeat of last year's men's final with eighth-ranked <PERSON>Andre Agassi</PERSON> landing in <PERSON>Sampras</PERSON>'s half of the draw .</S>
<S>Bumping <PERSON>Agassi</PERSON> up to the sixth seeding avoided the possibility that he would run into <PERSON>Sampras</PERSON> as early as the quarter-finals , but they could lock horns in the semis .</S>
<S>Olympic champion <PERSON>Agassi</PERSON> meets <PERSON>Karim Alami</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Morocco</LOCATION> in the first round .</S>
<S>Surprise second seed <PERSON>Michael Chang</PERSON> , ranked third in the world , opens against Czech <PERSON>Daniel Vacek</PERSON> , while women's second seed <PERSON>Monica Seles</PERSON> drew American <PERSON>Anne Miller</PERSON> as her first victim .</S>
<S>Second-ranked Austrian <PERSON>Thomas Muster</PERSON> , who was seeded third , did not have the luck of the draw with him .</S>
<S>In the first round <PERSON>Muster</PERSON> faces American <PERSON>Richey Reneberg</PERSON> , who has been playing some of the best tennis of his career of late .</S>
<S>If he survives , <PERSON>Muster</PERSON> is seeded to run into either fifth-seeded Wimbledon champion <PERSON>Richard Krajicek</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION> or 12th-seeded American <PERSON>Todd Martin</PERSON> in the quarter-finals in <PERSON>Chang</PERSON>'s half of the draw .</S>
<S>Perhaps the best , yet most unfortunate , first-round matchup of the men's competition pits eighth seed <PERSON>Jim Courier</PERSON> against retiring star <PERSON>Stefan Edberg</PERSON> .</S>
<S>The popular Swede is playing his final major tournament next week and the two-time champion's Grand Slam farewell could well be a one-match affair .</S>
<S>With the exception of a <PERSON>Philippoussis</PERSON> showdown , <PERSON>Sampras</PERSON> looks to have landed in a comfortable quarter of the draw with the likes of Frenchman <PERSON>Cedric Pioline</PERSON> and ailing French Open champion <PERSON>Yevgeny Kafelnikov</PERSON> , who is nursing a rib injury , in his path .</S>
<S><PERSON>Seles</PERSON> , runner-up to <PERSON>Graf</PERSON> last year , is seeded to run into fifth-ranked German <PERSON>Anke Huber</PERSON> in the quarter-finals with fourth seed <PERSON>Conchita Martinez</PERSON> or eighth-seeded Olympic champion <PERSON>Lindsay Davenport</PERSON> looking like her most likely semifinal opponents .</S>
<S>But <PERSON>Huber</PERSON> will be tested immediately with a first-round encounter against dangerous 18th-ranked South African <PERSON>Amanda Coetzer</PERSON> .</S>
<S><PERSON>Sanchez Vicario</PERSON> , runner-up to <PERSON>Graf</PERSON> at the French Open and Wimbledon , begins play against a qualifier in a quarter of the draw that includes young talent <PERSON>Martina Hingis</PERSON> , the 16th seed , before a probable quarter-final clash with seventh-seeded veteran <PERSON>Jana Novotna</PERSON> .</S>

<S><PERSON>Philippoussis</PERSON> saved a match point at 5-6 in the third-set tie break before winning 6-3 3-6 7-6 ( 8-6 ) .</S>
<S><PERSON>Philippoussis</PERSON>'s compatriot , 13th seed <PERSON>Jason Stoltenberg</PERSON> , was not as fortunate .</S>

<S>The way he was chipping and charging and serving and volleying I didn't really get my timing playing from the baseline . "</S>

<S><PERSON>Ivanisevic</PERSON> hit 32 aces but was outplayed from the back court by the 24-year-old <PERSON>Tillstrom</PERSON> .</S>

<S>I didn't feel good .</S>
<S>And I didn't have a good feeling as soon as I lost in my doubles ( on Tuesday ) . "</S>
<S>" I thought he looked a little unfocused at certain times on his ground strokes , " said <PERSON>Tillstrom</PERSON> .</S>
<S>The 19-year-old <PERSON>Philippoussis</PERSON> , who beat <PERSON>Sampras</PERSON> in the third round of this year's Australian Open , stayed calm in a nervy third-set tie break against <PERSON>Rosset</PERSON> .</S>
<S>" I'm pleased because I didn't play that great today , but I fought really well , " he said . "</S>
<S>When I was down 2-5 in the tiebreak ( in the third set ) , I just thought about winning my two serves and hoped that he might get tight .</S>
<S>Then he shanked a forehand at to make it 5-all and that helped me back . "</S>

<S>Palestinians accuse <ORGANIZATION>PA</ORGANIZATION> of banning books .</S>
<S><LOCATION>NABLUS</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>West Bank</LOCATION> 1996-08-22</S>
<S>A <LOCATION>West Bank</LOCATION> bookseller charged on Thursday that the <ORGANIZATION>Palestinian Information Ministry</ORGANIZATION> has forced him to sign an undertaking not to distribute books written by critics of Israeli-PLO self-rule deals .</S>
<S>" They made me sign an undertaking not to sell the books to anyone at the risk of legal action .</S>
<S>One official told me ' you have to either destroy the books or return them to <LOCATION>Amman</LOCATION> ' , " <PERSON>Daoud Makkawi</PERSON> , owner of the Nablus-based <LOCATION>al-Risala</LOCATION> bookshop , told <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>He said ministry officials made him sign this a few weeks ago after he brought about a dozen copies from <LOCATION>Jordan</LOCATION> of a book by <PERSON>Edward Said</PERSON> , a prominent scholar at <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Columbia University</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S><PERSON>Said</PERSON> , a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> citizen of Palestinian origin , has been an outspoken critic of the 1993 Israeli-PLO self-rule deal and has written at least two books on the accord .</S>
<S>On Wednesday a bookseller in the <LOCATION>West Bank</LOCATION> town of <LOCATION>Ramallah</LOCATION> said police about a month ago confiscated several copies of two of <PERSON>Said</PERSON>'s books on the Israel-PLO self-rule deals .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Palestinian Information Ministry</ORGANIZATION> Director-General <PERSON>Mutawakel Taha</PERSON> denied that ministry officials forced anyone to sign any undertaking and insisted that the <ORGANIZATION>Palestinian Authority</ORGANIZATION> has no plans to censor books .</S>
<S>" There is no strategy to ban books or to suppress freedom of expression in any form whatsoever , " <PERSON>Taha</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>But <PERSON>Taha</PERSON> said that the absence of relevent legislations may have resulted in some mistakes by some security officials .</S>
<S>" This may explain some mistakes against some journalists and writers , " he said .</S>
<S><PERSON>Daoud</PERSON> said books by other authors , including British Journalist <PERSON>Patrick Seale</PERSON> , were also banned .</S>
<S>He said that security officials often visit his shop to make sure he was not selling the books .</S>
<S>" I think this is a bad beginning .</S>
<S>If we have confidence , why should we be afraid of the other opinion ? "</S>
<S><PERSON>Daoud</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>Thousands of books were banned from sale in the <LOCATION>West Bank</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Gaza Strip</LOCATION> by the Israeli military authorities before the Jewish state handed over parts of the two areas to the <ORGANIZATION>PLO</ORGANIZATION> under a self-rule deal in 1994 .</S>

<S>The chairman of national carrier <ORGANIZATION>EgyptAir</ORGANIZATION> on Thursday blamed the control tower at <LOCATION>Istanbul</LOCATION> airport for the <ORGANIZATION>EgyptAir</ORGANIZATION> plane accident .</S>
<S>Twenty people were injured on Wednesday when the <ORGANIZATION>EgyptAir</ORGANIZATION> Boeing 707 overshot the runway , caught fire , hit a taxi and skipped across a road onto a railway line .</S>
<S>Chairman <PERSON>Mohamed Fahim Rayyan</PERSON> told a news conference at <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION> airport : " The control tower should have allocated the plane another runway , instead of the one the plane landed on . "</S>
<S>" The one it landed on is 2,250 metres ( 2,460 yards ) long while the other one if more than 3,000 metres ( 3,300 yards ) long and is less steep , " he added .</S>

<S>The <ORGANIZATION>EgyptAir</ORGANIZATION> pilot blamed Turkish airport staff for misleading him .</S>
<S>The landing took place after a rainstorm .</S>

<S>The Egyptian government will have nothing more to do with the Sudanese government because it continues to shelter and support Egyptian militants , President <PERSON>Hosni Mubarak</PERSON> said in a speech on Thursday .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> says the Sudanese government helped the Moslem militants who tried to kill <PERSON>Mubarak</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Addis Ababa</LOCATION> last year .</S>
<S>It sponsored last week's <ORGANIZATION>U.N. Security Council</ORGANIZATION> resolution threatening a ban on Sudanese flights abroad if <LOCATION>Khartoum</LOCATION> does not hand over three men accused in the <LOCATION>Addis Ababa</LOCATION> incident .</S>
<S>The sanctions will come into effect in November if <LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION> fails to extradite the men , but <LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION> says it cannot hand them over to <LOCATION>Ethiopia</LOCATION> for trial because they are not in <LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>" We are still eager that nothing should affect the Sudanese people but we will not deal with the current regime or the <PERSON>Turabi</PERSON> front or whatever , " <PERSON>Mubarak</PERSON> told a group of academics .</S>
<S><PERSON>Hassan al-Turabi</PERSON> is the leader of the <ORGANIZATION>National Islamic Front</ORGANIZATION> , the political force behind the Sudanese government .</S>
<S>" I don't want to go into more details than that but there are more details and they are bitter .</S>
<S>There are terrorists they are sheltering and they make Sudanese passorts for them and they get paid by them , " <PERSON>Mubarak</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>He did not say if <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> would go so far as to break relations , a step it has been reluctant to take , ostensibly because it would affect ordinary Sudanese .</S>

<S>Miss Universe , <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Alicia Machado</PERSON> , left <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> on Thursday , refusing to answer questions about her weight or claims she was told to either go on a crash diet or give up her title .</S>
<S><PERSON>Machado</PERSON> , 19 , flew to <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> after slipping away from the <LOCATION>New Mexico</LOCATION> desert town of <LOCATION>Las Cruces</LOCATION> , where she attended the 1996 Miss Teen USA pageant on Wednesday .</S>
<S>While <PERSON>Machado</PERSON> was not a contestant here , she came under intense scrutiny following reports she was given an ultimatum by Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION>Miss Universe Inc.</ORGANIZATION> to drop 27 pounds ( 12 kg ) in two weeks or risk losing her crown .</S>
<S>In <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> , her mother told <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON>Machado</PERSON> had a swollen face when she left home two weeks ago because she had her wisdom teeth extracted .</S>
<S><PERSON>Marta Fajardo</PERSON> insisted her daughter , who weighed 112 pounds ( 51 kg ) when she won the Miss Universe title in <LOCATION>Las Vegas</LOCATION> in May , had perfectly normal eating habits .</S>
<S>" Everybody has their own addiction to something or other but it's not as if she eats cakes like crazy , " she said .</S>
<S>Organisers flatly denied ever threatening <PERSON>Machado</PERSON> but immediately put her under wraps and blocked access to her .</S>
<S>Dressed in a black strapless evening gown at Wednesday's pageant , <PERSON>Machado</PERSON> was clearly heavier than the contestants but still won rave reviews after her brief appearance on stage .</S>
<S>" Are you kidding ?</S>
<S>She's fantastic , " said <PERSON>Nikki Campbell</PERSON> , 28 , who went to the pageant . "</S>
<S>She looked great .</S>
<S>Very sexy . "</S>

<S>Beauty queens are high-profile personalities in <LOCATION>Venezuela</LOCATION> and <PERSON>Machado</PERSON>'s alleged weight problem made front page news this week .</S>
<S>It was an official of the <ORGANIZATION>Miss Venezuela Organisation</ORGANIZATION> who first said <PERSON>Machado</PERSON> had been told to lose weight fast .</S>
<S>People close to her said she then eased up on her diet and indulged her passion for pasta and cake , but it was not clear how many pounds she gained and most people who saw her said she was still a long way from being fat .</S>
<S><PERSON>Martin Brooks</PERSON> , president of <ORGANIZATION>Miss Universe Inc</ORGANIZATION> , said he spoke with <PERSON>Machado</PERSON> to assure her that organisers were not putting pressure on her .</S>
<S>" She's fine with it .</S>
<S>She wished , as we all did , that it hadn't happened but she's spiritually and mentally terrific .</S>
<S>There's no problem whatsoever , " he told <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>He said the lifestyle associated with being Miss Universe could make routine exercise difficult .</S>
<S>" The problem is they travel so much and are so busy that the ability to have any type of regimented routine workout doesn't exist .</S>

<S>Defiant <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> neo-Nazi jailed by German court .</S>
<S><PERSON>Andrew Gray</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>HAMBURG</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> 1996-08-22</S>
<S>A <LOCATION>Hamburg</LOCATION> court sentenced <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> neo-Nazi leader <PERSON>Gary Lauck</PERSON> on Thursday to four years in prison for pumping banned extremist propaganda into <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> from his base in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> .</S>
<S><PERSON>Lauck</PERSON> , from <LOCATION>Lincoln</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Nebraska</LOCATION> , yelled a tirade of abuse at the court after his conviction for inciting racial hatred .</S>
<S>" The struggle will go on , " the 43-year-old shouted in German before being escorted out by security guards .</S>
<S><PERSON>Lauck</PERSON>'s lawyer vowed he would appeal against the court's decision , arguing that his client should have been set free because he had not committed any offence under German law .</S>
<S>The German government hailed the conviction as a major victory in the fight against neo-Nazism .</S>
<S><PERSON>Lauck</PERSON>'s worldwide network has been the main source of anti-Semitic propaganda material flowing into <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> since the 1970s .</S>
<S>" <PERSON>Lauck</PERSON> possessed a well-oiled propaganda machine , honed during more than 20 years , " presiding judge <PERSON>Guenter Bertram</PERSON> told the court .</S>
<S>" He set up a propaganda cannon and fired it at <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> . "</S>
<S>said <PERSON>Bertram</PERSON> , who also read out extracts from <PERSON>Lauck</PERSON>'s material praising <PERSON>Hitler</PERSON> as " the greatest of all leaders " and describing the Nazi slaughter of millions of Jews as a myth .</S>
<S>Eager to put <PERSON>Lauck</PERSON> behind bars quickly and avoid a long and complex trial , prosecutor <PERSON>Bernd Mauruschat</PERSON> limited his charges to offences since 1994 .</S>
<S>He had demanded a five-year jail term but said he was satisfied with the court's sentence .</S>
<S>Publishing and distributing neo-Nazi material is illegal in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> but <PERSON>Lauck</PERSON>'s defence team had argued that <LOCATION>U.S</LOCATION> freedom of speech laws meant he was free to produce his swastika-covered books , magazines , videos and flags in his homeland .</S>
<S>Interior Minister <PERSON>Manfred Kanther</PERSON> said in a statement he " welcomed the prosecution and conviction of one of the ringleaders of international neo-Nazism and biggest distributers of vicious racist publications " .</S>
<S>" It is high time he was behind bars , " the opposition Social Democrats said in a statement .</S>
<S><PERSON>Lauck</PERSON> , dressed in a sober blue suit and sporting his trademark Hitleresque black moustache , showed no sign of emotion as <PERSON>Bertram</PERSON> spent more than an hour reading out the verdict and explaining the court's decision .</S>
<S>But as <PERSON>Lauck</PERSON> was about to be led away , he turned to reporters and blurted out a virtually incomprehensible quick-fire diatribe against the court .</S>
<S>" Neither the National Socialists ( Nazis ) nor the communists dared to kidnap an American citizen , " he shouted , in an oblique reference to his extradition to <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> from <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION> . "</S>
<S>That's the truth . "</S>
<S>His attorney , <PERSON>Hans-Otto Sieg</PERSON> , told reporters outside the courtroom that the judges had not explained how a German court could judge someone for actions carried out in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> .</S>
<S><PERSON>Bertram</PERSON> said <PERSON>Lauck</PERSON> was obsessed by Nazism and devoted his life to leading his <ORGANIZATION>National Socialist German Workers ' Party Foreign Organisation</ORGANIZATION> ( <ORGANIZATION>NSDAP-AO</ORGANIZATION> ) , which derives its name from the full German title of <PERSON>Hitler</PERSON>'s Nazi party .</S>
<S>During the three-month trial , the court dealt mainly with issues of the <ORGANIZATION>NSDAP-AO</ORGANIZATION>'s " <ORGANIZATION>NS Kampfruf</ORGANIZATION> " ( " <ORGANIZATION>National Socialist Battle Cry</ORGANIZATION> " ) magazine , filled with references to Aryan supremacy and defamatory statements about Jews .</S>
<S>The court rejected <PERSON>Sieg</PERSON>'s argument that <PERSON>Lauck</PERSON>'s extradition from <LOCATION>Denmark</LOCATION> , where he was arrested in March last year at the request of German authorities , was illegal .</S>
<S><PERSON>Lauck</PERSON> was also convicted of disseminating the symbols of anti-constitutional organisations .</S>
<S>He will probably be free in around two and a half years .</S>
<S>The court ruled that the 15 months he has spent in custody since his arrest should be subtracted from his prison term .</S>

<S><LOCATION>NEW DELHI</LOCATION> 1996-08-22</S>
<S><LOCATION>India</LOCATION> said on Thursday that its opposition to a global nuclear test ban treaty did not mean <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> intended to enter into an arms race with neighbouring <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>Foreign Minister <PERSON>I.K. Gujral</PERSON> was asked at a news conference if <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s decision to block adoption of the accord in <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION> would lead to an arms race with <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>" I don't see that possibility because <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> is not entering into any arms race , " he said . "</S>
<S>Our not signing a new treaty does not mean we are going in for any new kind of weapons , particularly nuclear . "</S>
<S><LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , along with <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> , is a declared nuclear power .</S>
<S><LOCATION>India</LOCATION> carried out a nuclear test in 1974 but says it has not built the bomb .</S>
<S>Experts believe both <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> could quickly assemble nuclear weapons .</S>
<S><PERSON>Gujral</PERSON> said he did not expect <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s veto of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) to damage bilateral ties with other nations .</S>
<S>" I do not visualise its straining our bilateral relations with any country .</S>
<S>The text has already been blocked , " he said .</S>
<S><PERSON>Gujral</PERSON> said <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> would re-examine its position if the treaty , particularly a clause providing for its entry into force , was modified .</S>
<S>Asked what <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> would do if the pact were forwarded to the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Gujral</PERSON> said : " That bridge I will cross when I come to it . "</S>
<S>In a written statement released at the news conference , <PERSON>Gujral</PERSON> reiterated <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s objections to the treaty , under negotiation at the Conference on Disarmament in <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>" It is a sad fact that the nuclear weapon states show no interest in giving up their nuclear hegemony , " the statement said .</S>
<S><PERSON>Gujral</PERSON> said <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> had national security concerns that made it impossible for <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> to sign the CTBT .</S>
<S>" Our security concerns oblige us to maintain our nuclear option , " he said , adding that <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> had exercised restraint in not carrying out any nuclear tests since the country's lone test blast in 1974 .</S>
<S>He said : " We cannot accept constraints on our option as long as nuclear weapon states continue to rely on their nuclear arsenals for their security " .</S>

<S><PERSON>Mother Teresa</PERSON> devoted to world's poor .</S>
<S><LOCATION>CALCUTTA</LOCATION> 1996-08-22</S>
<S><PERSON>Mother Teresa</PERSON> , known as the <PERSON>Saint of the Gutters</PERSON> , won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for bringing hope and dignity to millions of poor , unwanted people with her simple message : " The poor must know that we love them . "</S>
<S>While the world heaps honours on her and even regards her as a living saint , the nun of Albanian descent maintains she is merely doing <PERSON>God</PERSON>'s work .</S>
<S>" It gives me great joy and fulfilment to love and care for the poor and neglected , " she said . "</S>
<S>The poor do not need our sympathy and pity .</S>
<S>They need our love and compassion . "</S>
<S>The diminutive Roman Catholic missionary was on respiratory support in intensive care in an Indian nursing home on Thursday after suffering heart failure .</S>
<S>But an attending doctor said <PERSON>Mother Teresa</PERSON> , who turns 86 next Tuesday , was conscious and in stable condition .</S>
<S>The task <PERSON>Mother Teresa</PERSON> began alone in 1949 in the slums of densely-populated <LOCATION>Calcutta</LOCATION> , and grew to touch the hearts of people around the world .</S>
<S>When in 1979 she was told she had won the Nobel Peace Prize , she said characteristically : " I am unworthy . "</S>
<S>The world disagreed , showering more than 80 national and international honours on her including the Bharat Ratna , or Jewel of India , the country's highest civilian award .</S>
<S>Her health began to deteriorate in 1989 when she was fitted with a heart pacemaker .</S>
<S>A year later , the <LOCATION>Vatican</LOCATION> announced she was stepping down as Superior of her <ORGANIZATION>Missionaries of Charity</ORGANIZATION> order .</S>
<S>More than 100 delegates flew in from around the world to elect a successor .</S>
<S>They could not agree , so asked her to stay on .</S>
<S>She agreed .</S>
<S>In 1991 , <PERSON>Mother Teresa</PERSON> was treated at a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> hospital for heart disease and bacterial pneumonia .</S>
<S>In 1993 , she fell in <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> and broke three ribs .</S>
<S>In August the same year , while in <LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION> to receive yet another award , she developed malaria , complicated by her heart and lung problems .</S>
<S>Last April she fractured her left collar bone .</S>
<S>But her increasing frailty , arthritis and failing eyesight has not stopped her travels around the world to mingle with the poor and desperate .</S>
<S><PERSON>Mother Teresa</PERSON> was born <PERSON>Agnes Goinxha Bejaxhiu</PERSON> to Albanian parents in <LOCATION>Skopje</LOCATION> , in what was then <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> , on August 27 , 1910 .</S>
<S>She attended a government school and was already deeply religious by the time she was 12 .</S>
<S>At the age of 18 she became a Loretto nun , hoping to work at the Order's <LOCATION>Calcutta</LOCATION> mission .</S>
<S>She was sent to <LOCATION>Loretto Abbey</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Dublin</LOCATION> and from there to <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> to begin her novitiate and teach geography at a convent school in <LOCATION>Calcutta</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>She said her divine call to work among the poor came in September , 1946 . "</S>
<S>The message was quite clear , " she told one interviewer . "</S>
<S>I was to leave the convent and help the poor while living among them .</S>
<S>It was an order .</S>
<S>I knew where I belonged . "</S>
<S>The <LOCATION>Vatican</LOCATION> and the mother superior in <LOCATION>Dublin</LOCATION> approved and after intensive training as a nurse with American missionaries she opened her first <LOCATION>Calcutta</LOCATION> slum school in December 1949 .</S>
<S>She took the name of <PERSON>Teresa</PERSON> , after <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s Saint <PERSON>Therese</PERSON> of the Child <PERSON>Jesus</PERSON> .</S>
<S>In <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> she was simply called <PERSON>Mother</PERSON> .</S>
<S><PERSON>Mother Teresa</PERSON> set up her first home for the dying in a Hindu rest house in <LOCATION>Calcutta</LOCATION> after she saw a penniless woman turned away by a city hospital .</S>
<S>Named " <LOCATION>Nirmal Hriday</LOCATION> " ( <LOCATION>Tender Heart</LOCATION> ) , it was the first of a chain of 150 homes for dying , destitute people , admitting nearly 18,000 a year .</S>
<S>Her <ORGANIZATION>Missionaries of Charity</ORGANIZATION> , a Roman Catholic religious order she founded in 1949 , now runs about 300 homes for unwanted children and the destitute in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and abroad .</S>

<S><ORGANIZATION>RTRS</ORGANIZATION> - FOCUS-News forecasts alien-led profit boost .</S>

<S><LOCATION>SYDNEY</LOCATION> 1996-08-22</S>
<S>Media baron <PERSON>Rupert Murdoch</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>News Corp Ltd</ORGANIZATION> reported lower than expected 1995/96 profits on Thursday , but forecast that the hit film " Independence Day " would help increase profits by at least 20 percent in 1996/97 .</S>
<S>" From an earnings perspective , the current fiscal year has begun with great promise due to the hit motion picture ' Independence Day , ' " <ORGANIZATION>News Corp</ORGANIZATION> said in a statement announcing its results for the year to June 30 , 1996 .</S>
<S>It said moderating paper prices and solid orders for advertising at its <ORGANIZATION>Fox Broadcasting</ORGANIZATION> television network in the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> would also help boost profits in the 1996/97 year . "</S>
<S>A budgeted profit increase of at least 20 percent for the full year currently appears very attainable , " <ORGANIZATION>News Corp</ORGANIZATION> said .</S>
<S>The bullish comments for the coming year soothed analysts and most shareholders , who were disappointed by the lower than expected profit for 1995/96 .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>News</ORGANIZATION> announced pre-abnormals net profit for the year fell six percent to A$ 1.26 billion ( US$ 995 million ) and earnings per share dropped to 40 cents from 46 cents .</S>
<S>Analysts had on average expected a pre-abnormals profit of A$ 1.343 billion .</S>
<S>" The year just gone was disappointing , but the outlook for the current year looks good , " <ORGANIZATION>First Pacific</ORGANIZATION> media analyst <PERSON>Lachlan Drummond</PERSON> said .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>News Corp</ORGANIZATION> said strong performances in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> television and British newspapers were offset by lower profits from <ORGANIZATION>News Corp</ORGANIZATION>'s magazine and publishing divisions and further hefty losses from its <ORGANIZATION>Asian Star TV</ORGANIZATION> operations .</S>
<S>Higher newsprint prices hit profits hard . "</S>
<S>Throughout the group , higher paper prices increased costs by over US$ 300 million , " it said .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>News Corp</ORGANIZATION> said British newspaper operating profits rose 10 percent for the year , as higher cover prices at <ORGANIZATION>The Sun</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>The Times</ORGANIZATION> and higher advertising volumes offset increased newsprint costs .</S>
<S>Advertising revenues at <ORGANIZATION>The Times</ORGANIZATION> grew 20 percent .</S>
<S>Analysts said sharply lower earnings from <ORGANIZATION>News Corp</ORGANIZATION>'s book publishing division and its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> magazines had been the major surprises in the results for 1995/96 .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>News Corp</ORGANIZATION> said revenue gains at its magazines and inserts division were offset by higher paper prices and lower sales at the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION>TV Guide</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>News</ORGANIZATION> said dramatically lower earnings from the British arm of its <ORGANIZATION>Harper-Collins</ORGANIZATION> publishing division more than offset healthy results from its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> operation .</S>
<S>It said the demise of the Net Book Agreement had hurt the British operations , and weak performances from the <LOCATION>San Francisco</LOCATION> unit of <ORGANIZATION>Harper-Collins</ORGANIZATION> had not helped .</S>
<S>The minimum price setting expired last September when three publishers pulled out .</S>
<S>But it was the bullish profit forecast for 1996/97 that took the spotlight in the market , with some analysts saying 20 percent may even be an understatement .</S>
<S>" If they're saying at least 20 percent , then their internal forecasts are probably saying 25 or 30 percent , " said one <LOCATION>Sydney</LOCATION> media analyst who declined to be named .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>News Corp</ORGANIZATION>'s shares were down eight cents at A$ 6.39 at 2.00 p.m. ( 0400 GMT ) in a soft market .</S>

<S><LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION> hails peace as marks five-year independence .</S>
<S><PERSON>Rostislav Khotin</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>KIEV</LOCATION> 1996-08-23</S>
<S><LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION> celebrates five years of independence from <LOCATION>Kremlin</LOCATION> rule on Saturday , hailing civil and inter-ethnic peace as its main post-Soviet achievement .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION>'s declaration of independence in 1991 , backed nine-to-one by a referendum in December of that year , effectively dealt a death blow to the Soviet empire and ended more than three centuries of rule from <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION> , with a Russian community of 11 million people -- the world's largest outside <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> -- has avoided conflicts like those in <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Chechnya</LOCATION> , neighbouring <LOCATION>Moldova</LOCATION> , and the former Soviet republics of <LOCATION>Georgia</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Azerbaijan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Tajikistan</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>" <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION>'s biggest achievements for five years are the preservation of civil peace and inter-ethnic harmony , " President <PERSON>Leonid Kuchma</PERSON> said in televised statement this week .</S>
<S>" Unlike many other post-Soviet countries we were able to deal with conflict situations in a peaceful and civilised way . "</S>
<S>But independence was initially accompanied by hyper-inflation and economic collapse , although there are signs of a turnaround .</S>
<S>Inflation -- a hyper-inflationary 10,300 percent a year in 1993 -- was a respectable 0.1 percent a month in June and July and the economy has just begun to grow .</S>
<S><PERSON>Kuchma</PERSON> told a solemn ceremony at the <LOCATION>Ukraina Palace</LOCATION> on Friday that " there was a turning point " in reforms and that he expected a rise in the standard of living in the near future .</S>
<S>" There is no doubt that economic growth has already started , " said <PERSON>Adelbert Knobl</PERSON> , head of the <ORGANIZATION>International Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION>'s mission in <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION> . "</S>
<S>The national bank and the government have every reason to be proud of their efforts . "</S>
<S>Central bank officials said on Thursday that a much-postponed hryvna currency would " definitely " be introduced before the end of this year .</S>
<S>It will replace the interim karbovanets currency , which was introduced at par to the Russian rouble in 1992 but now trades at almost 33 karbovanets per rouble .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION> has repeatedly promised to introduce the hryvna but had to postpone the plans because of economic problems .</S>
<S>Proud of its record in promptly joining both the <ORGANIZATION>Council of Europe</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION>'s Partnership for Peace , <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION> caused a foreign policy wrangle this week , offending <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> by allowing a Taiwanese minister to appear on a public , if unofficial visit .</S>
<S><LOCATION>China</LOCATION> cancelled a visit by a top-level delegation in protest .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Kiev</LOCATION>'s Foreign Minister <PERSON>Hennady Udovenko</PERSON> said <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> was overreacting .</S>
<S>But <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION> , seeing itself as a bridge between <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> and the rapidly Westernising countries of eastern <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> , is looking West as well as East .</S>
<S>" The strategic aim of European integration should not in any way damage <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION>'s interests in post-Soviet areas .</S>
<S>Relations with <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> , which is our main partner , have great importance , " <PERSON>Kuchma</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>" But <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION> cannot be economically oriented on <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> , even though those in some circles push us to do that . "</S>
<S><PERSON>Kuchma</PERSON> has said <LOCATION>Kiev</LOCATION> wants membership of the <ORGANIZATION>European Union</ORGANIZATION> , associate membership of the <ORGANIZATION>Western European Union</ORGANIZATION> defence grouping and to move closer to <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>A message from the West this week from <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> congratulated <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION> on the anniversary , promising to support market reforms and praising <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION> as a " stabilising factor " in a united <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> .</S>

<S>A 16th-century document , the earliest complete example of written Albanian , has disappeared from the <LOCATION>Vatican</LOCATION> archives , an Albanian newspaper said on Friday .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Gazeta Shqiptare</ORGANIZATION> said the " Book of Mass ' , by <PERSON>Gjon Buzuku</PERSON> , dating from 1555 and discovered in 1740 in a religious seminary in <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> , was the first major document published in the Albanian language .</S>
<S>" We Albanians , sons of Buzuku , believed our language had a written document but now we do not have it any more , " lamented scholar <PERSON>Musa Hamiti</PERSON> , told of the loss by the <LOCATION>Vatican</LOCATION> library .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Tirana</LOCATION>'s national library has three copies of the " Book of Mass ' . "</S>
<S>There is nothing left for us but to be grateful to civilisation for inventing photocopies , " <ORGANIZATION>Gazeta Shqiptare</ORGANIZATION> said .</S>

<S><LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> to clamp down on barter deals .</S>
<S><LOCATION>MOSCOW</LOCATION> 1996-08-23</S>
<S>Russian officials , keen to cut capital flight , will adopt tight measures to cut barter deals in foreign trade to a minimum , a customs official said on Friday .</S>
<S>" We have always been concerned about barter deals with other countries , viewing them as a disguised kind of capital flight from <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> , " <PERSON>Marina Volkova</PERSON> , deputy head of the currency department at the <ORGANIZATION>State Customs Committee</ORGANIZATION> , told <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S><PERSON>Volkova</PERSON> said last year goods had been exported under many Russian barter deals , with nothing imported in return .</S>
<S>She said the cost of such unimported goods was $ 1.10 billion in 1995 .</S>
<S>Barter deals were worth $ 4.9 billion last year , or about eight percent of all Russian exports estimated at $ 61.5 billion , she said .</S>
<S>" The cost of exported goods is too often understated , so the actual share of barter deals in Russian exports and the amount of unimported goods may be even higher , " <PERSON>Volkova</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>A few days ago Russian President <PERSON>Boris Yeltsin</PERSON> issued a decree on state regulation of foreign barter deals , and <PERSON>Volkova</PERSON> said this " could substantially improve the situation " .</S>
<S>In line with the decree , which will come into force on November 1 , all Russian barter traders will be obliged to import goods worth the cost of their exports within 180 days .</S>
<S>" If traders are late , they will have to pay fines worth the cost of their exported goods , " <PERSON>Volkova</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>Understating the cost of exported goods could still be a loophole for barter dealers , but <PERSON>Volkova</PERSON> said the authorities are currently " tackling the technicalities of the issue " .</S>
<S>Barter has always been a feature of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION>'s foreign trade , but <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s decrees liberalising foreign trade in 1991-1992 has given barter a new impetus .</S>
<S>A few years ago , barter deals accounted for up to 25-30 percent of Russian exports because " thousands ( of ) trade companies which popped up preferred barter in the absence of reliable Russian banks and money transfer systems " , <PERSON>Volkova</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>" Now many Russian banks are strong and can make various sorts of money tranfers , while incompetent traders are being ousted by more experienced ones .</S>
<S>But the current share of barter deals in Russian exports is still high , " she said .</S>

<S><ORGANIZATION>Paramount Pictures</ORGANIZATION> is going ahead with a sequel to the <PERSON>Tom Cruise</PERSON> blockbuster , " Mission : Impossible " and hopes to release it in the summer of 1998 , <ORGANIZATION>Daily Variety</ORGANIZATION> reported in its Friday edition .</S>
<S>The big-screen version of the spy TV series has grossed $ 175 million domestically since opening May 22 , and $ 338 million overseas so far .</S>
<S>It's the biggest success for Viacom Inc-owned <ORGANIZATION>Paramount</ORGANIZATION> since 1994's " Forrest Gump " .</S>
<S>However , many critics complained its plot was incomprehensible .</S>
<S><PERSON>Cruise</PERSON> will reprise his roles as star and co-producer , and will soon meet Academy Award-winning screenwriter <PERSON>William Goldman</PERSON> , who will write the script , the report said .</S>
<S>It said " Mission : Impossible " director <PERSON>Brian De Palma</PERSON> would have first crack at the sequel , though no deals have been made yet .</S>
<S><PERSON>Goldman</PERSON> , whose Oscars were for " Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid " and " All the President's Men " , earlier this summer criticised some of the season's blockbusters .</S>
<S>However , he singled out " Mission : Impossible " as an especially entertaining movie , <ORGANIZATION>Daily Variety</ORGANIZATION> said .</S>

<S><LOCATION>England</LOCATION> batsman <PERSON>John Crawley</PERSON> was forced to endure a frustrating delay of over three hours before resuming his quest for a maiden test century in the third test against <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> on Friday .</S>

<S>Unseeded <PERSON>Patrick Rafter</PERSON> recorded the most noteworthy result as he upset sixth-seeded American <PERSON>MaliVai Washington</PERSON> 6-2 6-1 in just 50 minutes .</S>
<S><PERSON>Todd Woodbridge</PERSON> , who defeated Canadian <PERSON>Daniel Nestor</PERSON> 7-6 ( 7-2 ) 7-6 ( 7-4 ) , and <PERSON>Mark Philippoussis</PERSON> , a 6-3 6-4 winner over <PERSON>Bohdan Ulihrach</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>Czech Republic</LOCATION> , also advanced and will meet in Friday's quarter-finals .</S>
<S>Third-seeded <PERSON>Wayne Ferreira</PERSON> of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> defeated <PERSON>Tim Henman</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> 6-4 6-4 after a three-hour evening rain delay and fifth-seeded <PERSON>Thomas Enqvist</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> won his third-round match , eliminating <PERSON>Petr Korda</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>Czech Republic</LOCATION> 6-3 6-4 .</S>

<S>" If you really look at the match , " said the 12th-ranked <PERSON>Washington</PERSON> after losing to the 70th-ranked <PERSON>Rafter</PERSON> , " I never really got a chance to play because he was serving big and getting in close to the net .</S>
<S>" He was also able to handle my serve pretty easily because my ( first ) service percentage was only in the 40s .</S>
<S>Put those two things together and you get a loss . "</S>
<S><PERSON>Rafter</PERSON> missed 10 weeks after wrist surgery earlier this year and the time away from tennis has given him a new perspective .</S>
<S>" Before when I was on tour , I always felt I had to be in bed by 9:30 or 10 o'clock and I had to be up at a certain time , " <PERSON>Rafter</PERSON> said . "</S>
<S>Now I can go to bed at at midnight or wake up at seven in the morning .</S>
<S>I just don't have as many set routines and it's made me a happier person . "</S>
<S><PERSON>Martin</PERSON> was pleased with his victory over <PERSON>Pioline</PERSON> , his first in five meetings with the 11th-ranked Frenchman . "</S>
<S>It's always difficult to win a match when you lose the first set , especially against someone you have never beaten , " he said .</S>
<S>" I got more aggressive in the second and third sets and the wind picked up and that also affected things because <PERSON>Cedric</PERSON> definitely went off a little bit . "</S>
<S>The 26-year-old <PERSON>O'Brien</PERSON> , who won the ATP Tour stop in <LOCATION>New Haven</LOCATION> last week , has now won 18 of his last 20 matches , dating back to qualifying rounds in <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> in late July .</S>
<S>He ranks 76th after being 285th four weeks ago .</S>
<S>" I feel I'm hitting the ball well even though I'm having more mental letdowns than I did last week , " <PERSON>O'Brien</PERSON> said . "</S>
<S>But I'm still competing well . "</S>
<S>" I got a lot of first serves in , " said <PERSON>Enqvist</PERSON> about his victory over <PERSON>Korda</PERSON> . "</S>
<S>I didn't miss that many shots and he was making the mistakes . "</S>
<S>Still marvelling at an exciting 64-stroke rally he won in the last game of his second-round match against <PERSON>Javier Sanchez</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> on Tuesday , <PERSON>Enqvist</PERSON> joked , " Today against <PERSON>Petr</PERSON> there were about 64 strokes in the whole match .</S>
<S>It was mostly short points . "</S>

<S><LOCATION>BRUSSELS</LOCATION> 1996-08-23</S>
<S><LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>'s double Olympic champion <PERSON>Svetlana Masterkova</PERSON> smashed her second world record in just 10 days on Friday when she bettered the mark for the women's 1,000 metres .</S>
<S>After breaking the world record for the women's mile in <LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION> last Wednesday , the Olympic 800 and 1,500 metres champion clocked two minutes 28.98 seconds over 1,000 at the <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> grand prix meeting .</S>
<S>The Russian ate up the ground in a swift last lap to shave 0.36 seconds off the previous best of 2:29.34 set by <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Maria Mutola</PERSON> in the same stadium in August last year .</S>
<S>Former world 800 champion <PERSON>Mutola</PERSON> pushed <PERSON>Masterkova</PERSON> all the way , finishing second in 2:29.66 .</S>
<S>But it was the Russian who picked up the bonus of $ 25,000 for the historic run in front of a capacity 40,000 crowd .</S>
<S><PERSON>Masterkova</PERSON> dominated the middle-distance races at the recent Atlanta Games following her return to competition this season after a three-year maternity break .</S>
<S>In her first mile race at the richest meeting in <LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION> last Wednesday , she slashed 3.05 seconds off the previous record .</S>
<S>The record of four minutes , 12.56 seconds in <LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION> earned <PERSON>Masterkova</PERSON> a bonus of $ 50,000 plus one kilo of gold .</S>
<S>After Friday's performance the Russian will have earned well over $ 100,000 in less than a fortnight , taking her appearance money into account .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> organisers had laid a new track for the meeting comparable to the surface at the Atlanta Games but put down on a softer surface .</S>
<S><PERSON>Masterkova</PERSON> clearly enjoyed it .</S>
<S><PERSON>Mutola</PERSON> looked threatening in the final 200 metres but the Russian found an extra gear to power home several strides ahead , pointing at the time on the clock with delight as she crossed the line .</S>

<S><PERSON>Adrian Warner</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>BRUSSELS</LOCATION> 1996-08-23</S>
<S>American <PERSON>Dennis Mitchell</PERSON> upstaged a trio of past and present Olympic 100 metres champions on Friday with a storming victory at the <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> grand prix .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Sporting</ORGANIZATION> his customary bright green outfit , the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> champion clocked 10.03 seconds despite damp conditions to take the scalp of <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s reigning Olympic champion <PERSON>Donovan Bailey</PERSON> , 1992 champion <PERSON>Linford Christie</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and American 1984 and 1988 champion <PERSON>Carl Lewis</PERSON> .</S>
<S><PERSON>Mitchell</PERSON> also beat world and Olympic champion <PERSON>Bailey</PERSON> at the most lucrative meeting in the sport in <LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION> last week .</S>
<S>The American , who finished fourth at the Atlanta Games , was fast out of his blocks and held off <PERSON>Bailey</PERSON>'s late burst in the final 20 metres before heading off for a lap of celebration .</S>
<S>The Canadian was second in 10.09 with <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> third in 10.10 , ahead of <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> bronze medallist <PERSON>Ato Boldon</PERSON> who clocked 10.12 in fourth .</S>
<S><PERSON>Christie</PERSON> , competing in what is expected to be his last major international meeting , finished fifth in 10.14 .</S>
<S><PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> , making a rare appearance in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> in a sprint race , left the track with a slight limp .</S>
<S>American Olympic high hurdles champion <PERSON>Allen Johnson</PERSON> defied the wet conditions to produce a brilliant 12.92 seconds in the 110 metres race , just 0.01 outside the world record held by <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Colin Jackson</PERSON> .</S>
<S><PERSON>Johnson</PERSON> ran the same time at the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Olympic trials in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> in June to become the second equal fastest hurdler of all time with American <PERSON>Roger Kingdom</PERSON> .</S>
<S>He seemed to relish the new track at the <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> meeting , dominating the race from start to finish with a slight wind at his back .</S>
<S><PERSON>Jackson</PERSON> , the only man to have run faster , could not live with his speed , taking second in 13.24 seconds .</S>
<S>The rain was pelting down when the women's high hurdlers stepped up for their 100 metres race .</S>
<S>But <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>'s Olympic high hurdles champion <PERSON>Ludmila Engquist</PERSON> , who crashed out of last week's meeting in <LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION> after hitting a hurdle , also kept her footing perfectly to win in a fast 12.60 seconds .</S>
<S>Olympic silver medallist <PERSON>Brigita Bukovec</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Slovenia</LOCATION> could finish only fifth in the race in 12.95 .</S>
<S>Jamaican <ORGANIZATION>Commonwealth</ORGANIZATION> champion <PERSON>Michelle Freeman</PERSON> took second in 12.77 ahead of Cuban <PERSON>Aliuska Lopez</PERSON> .</S>
<S>The <LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION> fall cost <PERSON>Engquist</PERSON> a shot at a jackpot of 20 one-kg gold bars which can be won by athletes who clinch their events at all of the Golden Four series in <LOCATION>Oslo</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>Seven athletes went into Friday's penultimate meeting of the series with a chance of winning the prize and American men's 400 metres hurdles champion <PERSON>Derrick Adkins</PERSON> kept his hopes alive in the competition by winning his event in 47.93 .</S>
<S>American Olympic champion <PERSON>Gail Devers</PERSON> clocked a swift 10.84 seconds on her way to victory in the women's 100 metres , the second fastest time of the season and 0.10 seconds faster than her winning time in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>Jamaican veteran <PERSON>Merlene Ottey</PERSON> , who beat <PERSON>Devers</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Zurich</LOCATION> after just missing out on the gold medal in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> after a photo finish , had to settle for third place in 11.04 .</S>
<S>American world champion <PERSON>Gwen Torrence</PERSON> , the bronze medallist in <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> , was second in 11.00 .</S>
<S>It was a costly defeat for <PERSON>Ottey</PERSON> since it threw her out of the race for the Golden Four jackpot .</S>

<S>The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Colombian governments reached an agreement that will allow <ORGANIZATION>AMR Corp</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION> to operate three round-trip flights between <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Bogota</LOCATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>Department of Transportation</ORGANIZATION> said Friday .</S>
<S>Under the agreement , which followed talks in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> this week , <ORGANIZATION>AMR</ORGANIZATION> also will be allowed to shift up to four of the weekly flights it now operates between <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> to its <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> gateway .</S>
<S>The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> also will be able to designate one new all-cargo carrier for service between the two nations after two years .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> was permitted to add a single additional round-trip flight to its current <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> service , although it will not be able to do so while under Category Two ( Conditional ) status under the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Aviation Administration</ORGANIZATION>'s International Aviation Safety program .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> would be allowed to add new service when its safety assessment has been improved , the department said .</S>
<S>With the exception of the new services just agreed to , the governments of the two nations have agreed to maintain their current level of routes and airlines for the next 2-1/2 years , the agreement said .</S>
<S>The agreement resolved a dispute that arose in June when <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> turned down <ORGANIZATION>American</ORGANIZATION>'s request to operate flights between <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Bogota</LOCATION> , a denial that prompted the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> to charge that the Colombians were breaking a bilateral aviation agreement and to propose sanctions against one of two Colombian airlines , <ORGANIZATION>Avianca</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>ACES</ORGANIZATION> .</S>

<S>Soccer - Arab team breaks new ground in <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> .</S>
<S><PERSON>Ori Lewis</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>TAIBE</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> 1996-08-23</S>
<S>For the first time in Israeli history , an Arab team will take the field when the National League soccer season starts on Saturday .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Hapoel Taibe</ORGANIZATION> fields four Jewish players and two foreign imports -- a Pole and a Romanian .</S>
<S>The rest of the side is made up mainly of Moslem Arabs .</S>
<S>The club , founded in 1961 , has a loyal following in <LOCATION>Taibe</LOCATION> , an Arab town of 28,000 in the heart of <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>But away from their home ground , they face unfriendly crowds who taunt the players with racist abuse .</S>
<S>" The very first thing we thought about after we knew we would be promoted was the game against <ORGANIZATION>Betar Jerusalem</ORGANIZATION> , " said <ORGANIZATION>Taibe</ORGANIZATION> supporter <PERSON>Karem Haj Yihye</PERSON> .</S>
<S>Two weeks ago <ORGANIZATION>Taibe</ORGANIZATION> , coached by Pole <PERSON>Wojtek Lazarek</PERSON> , met <ORGANIZATION>Betar</ORGANIZATION> , a club closely associated with the right-wing <ORGANIZATION>Likud</ORGANIZATION> party , for the first time in a Cup match in <LOCATION>Jerusalem</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>Chants from the crowd of " Death to the Arabs " , and bottle-throwing during the game marred the match which ended in a goalless draw .</S>
<S>One <ORGANIZATION>Taibe</ORGANIZATION> supporter required hospital treatment for cuts and bruises after a stone struck his head as he was driving from the stadium .</S>
<S>" We're used to hearing the taunts of " Death to the Arabs ' , " said <PERSON>Sameh Haj Yihye</PERSON> , a <LOCATION>Taibe</LOCATION> resident who studies at <LOCATION>Jerusalem</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Hebrew University</ORGANIZATION> . "</S>
<S>But we know that these are only words , nobody has died from hearing them and it only makes us support our team more vehemently . "</S>
<S>The dusty town of <LOCATION>Taibe</LOCATION> lacks the amenities of Jewish communities and many Israeli Arabs have long complained of state discrimination .</S>
<S>" There are no parks or empty areas of land around here , so when we want to play a friendly game of soccer we all load up in the car and travel to <LOCATION>Tel Aviv</LOCATION> , " 60 km ( 36 miles ) away , <PERSON>Sameh Haj Yihye</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>The town's ramshackle 2,500-seat ground is accessible only by two dirt tracks .</S>
<S>" We plan to build a 10,000-seat stadium , but it may well be situated elsewhere , " said club chairman <PERSON>Abdul Rahman Haj Yihye</PERSON> . "</S>
<S>We will discuss this with the mayor and hopefully a new or refurbished ground will be completed by the start of the new year . "</S>
<S>In the meantime , <ORGANIZATION>Taibe</ORGANIZATION> will play all their heavily policed home matches at the Jewish coastal town of <LOCATION>Netanya</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>" We are Israelis , there is no question about that , " said <PERSON>Karem Haj Yihye</PERSON> , a hotel waiter .</S>
<S>" We don't have any connection with the Palestinians , they live over there , " he said , pointing to the <LOCATION>West Bank</LOCATION> seven km ( four miles ) to the east .</S>
<S>" We don't feel our club represents Palestinian Arabs , " said club chairman <PERSON>Abdul Rahman</PERSON> . "</S>
<S>We are trying to do all we can to run a professional outfit , we are pleased at any support we get , but do not go out looking to represent the whole Arab world . "</S>

<S><LOCATION>Jordan</LOCATION> , which has blamed <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> for bread riots last week , has asked an Iraqi diplomat to leave , official and diplomatic sources said on Friday .</S>
<S>The main Friday prayers in southern <LOCATION>Jordan</LOCATION> that were the starting point for the riots a week ago passed peacefully under tight security imposed by the army with only brief demonstrations reported .</S>
<S><PERSON>Adel Ibrahim</PERSON> , the Iraqi embassy's press attache , was asked to leave " because he was carrying out duties incompatible with diplomatic norms " , one source told <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION> , implying he was accused of spying .</S>
<S><PERSON>Ibrahim</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION> by telephone from his embassy office in <LOCATION>Amman</LOCATION> that he " had not been notified " of any explusion order .</S>
<S>The government declined official comment .</S>
<S><PERSON>Ibrahim</PERSON>'s assistant , <PERSON>Hussein Khalaf</PERSON> , was expelled earlier this year for similar reasons amid rising tension in bilateral ties after King <PERSON>Hussein</PERSON> began calling for change in <LOCATION>Baghdad</LOCATION> following top Iraqi defections in August 1995 .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> retaliated then by expelling a junior administrator working in the Jordanian embassy in <LOCATION>Baghdad</LOCATION> but has continued its policy of trying to avoid public conflicts with <LOCATION>Jordan</LOCATION> -- its only secure route to the rest of the world .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Jordan</LOCATION> has accused <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> and a local pro-Baghdad party for the country's worst unrest in seven years which erupted after it almost doubled the prices of bread last week under radical economic reforms agreed with the <ORGANIZATION>International Monetary Fund</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>In <LOCATION>Karak</LOCATION> , where two days of riots flared last Friday , a few hundred young men lingered outside <LOCATION>Omari</LOCATION> mosque on leaving , shouting slogans for about 15 minutes .</S>
<S>" Disperse , abstain from forming groups and help maintain order , " army officers , who has enforced a loose curfew since the riots , told the crowd through loudspeakers .</S>
<S>The men shouted " <PERSON>Allahu</PERSON> Akbar " ( <PERSON>God</PERSON> is Greatest ) as a former Islamist deputy , <PERSON>Ahmed Kafawin</PERSON> , told soldiers the crowd would not cause trouble .</S>
<S>He had earlier mounted the mosque's pulpit to demand release of detainees , an end to raids on houses and the cancelling of the bread price rises .</S>
<S>Armoured cars had patrolled streets in <LOCATION>Karak</LOCATION> , traditional bastion of communist ideology and Baath socialism that swept the region in the 1950s , and guarded entrances to the hill-top city famed for its Crusader castle before the prayers .</S>
<S>There was also heavy security in the crowded centre of <LOCATION>Amman</LOCATION> , where smaller clashes had erupted last Saturday , but Friday prayers at the main mosque ended quietly as police in full riot gear looked on .</S>
<S>The <ORGANIZATION>Jordanian Arab Socialist Baath Party</ORGANIZATION> , which has one deputy in the 80-seat lower house of parliament , has denied involvement in unrest which it blamed on government policies and rising economic hardship .</S>
<S>Government attempts to link the rioting to foreign influence has been treated with derision by those in the streets who blame the protests on severe economic hardships .</S>

<S>OPTIONS - Euro debt vols seen regrouping after fall .</S>
<S><LOCATION>LONDON</LOCATION> 1996-08-23</S>
<S>Implied volatility of European bond and interest rate options should stabilise around current levels until early next week after falling before and after this week's German-led cut in interest rates , traders said .</S>
<S>" Volatility has come off a lot .</S>
<S>We're looking for it to stabilise now , " said one Euromark options trader at a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> bank .</S>
<S>A trader at a Japanese bank said Euromark volatility now stood at 14.00 for September contract , 16.75 for December , 19.50 for March and 21.25 for June .</S>
<S>This compared with midweek levels , before the welter of interest rate cuts , of 18.50 for September , 20.00 for December , 22.00 for March and 23.5 for June , he said .</S>
<S>At 1347 GMT , December Euromark futures were trading at 96.78 , two basis points down on the day .</S>
<S>He said the sell-off in June vols might have been overdone , which could offer value at current levels .</S>
<S>He said caps and floors would be well bid after the round of interest rate cuts due to the fact these rates should stay low at the short end .</S>
<S>The size of the <ORGANIZATION>Bundesbank</ORGANIZATION>'s repo rate cut , to 3.00 percent from 3.30 percent , took markets by surprise .</S>
<S>" Volatility has a bid to it -- longer-dated volatility more than short-dated because the event people were buying for has passed and now perhaps people will sell some short dated vol and buy some long dated vol , " he said .</S>
<S>" Long dated volatility has been low this year , so it is still at levels which are not historically high .</S>
<S>" It is not a dangerous level to own vol. You are not going to lose a lot and you could make quite a bit . "</S>
<S>He said volatility levels should be stable until markets reassess the situation after a long weekend in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Paribas Capital Markets OTC</ORGANIZATION> options specialist <PERSON>Robert Coughlan</PERSON> said that if volatility continued lower for the rest of Friday in over-the-counter 10-year Bunds , it should be higher next Tuesday .</S>
<S>He said the absence on holiday of many market makers was a main factor behind falls this week in volatility in high-yielding markets such as <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION> .</S>
<S><PERSON>Coughlan</PERSON> said the market had more downside than upside potential , but a fall was not likely to be of significant size .</S>
<S>" I recommend people sell strangles in a number of markets -- in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> in particular .</S>
<S>" With high-yielding markets <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> will be a lot more vulnerable in September on economic and political fronts , so I would use current the low level of vol to buy options .</S>
<S>" So sell options on Bunds and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> to enhance yield and buy options on <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> , " <PERSON>Coughlan</PERSON> said ..</S>

<S><ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> lands $ 1 billion contract , plans $ 100 million plant .</S>
<S><PERSON>Susan Nadeau</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>CHICAGO</LOCATION> 1996-08-22</S>
<S>A consortium of telephone companies and <ORGANIZATION>The Walt Disney Co</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>said Thursday it had signed a $ 1 billion contract with <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> to make digital televison set-top boxes for its home entertainment service .</S>
<S>The announcement of the contract for 3 million set-top boxes gave new hope to <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> , which has struggled with years of losses .</S>
<S>" This really indicates we're back in the business , " <PERSON>William Luehrs</PERSON> , president of the <LOCATION>Glenview</LOCATION> , Ill.-based company's <ORGANIZATION>Networks Services Division</ORGANIZATION> , said in a telephone interview . "</S>
<S>Anytime somebody gets the opportunity to enter the next era with such a big bang has got to be seen as a strong message to the industry . "</S>
<S>Following the announcement , <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION>'s stock soared $ 5.50 to $ 16.875 on the <ORGANIZATION>New York Stock Exchange</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>The consortium , called <ORGANIZATION>Americast</ORGANIZATION> , said the contract was part of its strategy to develop and market the next generation in home entertainment .</S>
<S>In addition to <ORGANIZATION>Disney</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Americast</ORGANIZATION>'s partners are phone companies <ORGANIZATION>Ameritech Corp.</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>BellSouth Corp.</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>GTE Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>SBC Communications</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Americast</ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION>Southern New England Telecommunications Corp.</ORGANIZATION> has signed a letter of intent to join the group , which plans to provide a home entertainment service similar to cable television .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> also said it planned to build a new $ 100 million plant in <LOCATION>Woodridge</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Ill</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>, to make picture tubes for 32- and 35-inch screen TV sets .</S>
<S>The company currently buys the tubes from competitors .</S>
<S>The new plant , which is dependent on obtaining financing , will create about 280 new jobs , <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> said .</S>
<S>The contract calls for production of the set-top boxes over five years .</S>
<S><PERSON>Luehrs</PERSON> said manufacturing will begin and revenue will start to roll in during the first half of next year .</S>
<S>The boxes will be made on a build-to-order basis .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> will convert its <LOCATION>Chihuahua</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> , analogue set-top box plant to manufacture the digital boxes .</S>
<S><PERSON>Luehrs</PERSON> declined to say when the operation was expected to be profitable .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Americast</ORGANIZATION> will provide the boxes to subscribers as part of the service .</S>
<S>Its service is being introduced in selected markets across the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> .</S>
<S><PERSON>Luehrs</PERSON> said digital technology in set-top boxes is only the beginning and said the technology will eventually show up in retail consumer electronics .</S>
<S>" We'll build a lot of these devices into television sets , for digital television , " he said . "</S>
<S>Although that is not where this particular contract is headed , the fact that there is a strong <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> presence will pay us dividends in the future . "</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> has been plagued by generally soft conditions in the colour television industry , reporting full-year losses since 1989 .</S>
<S>Last month , it reported a second-quarter loss of $ 33.2 million , or 51 cents a share , vs. a loss of $ 45.3 million , or 97 cents a share , a year earlier .</S>
<S>Last November , South Korea-based <ORGANIZATION>LG Electronics Inc.</ORGANIZATION> bought a majority stake in <ORGANIZATION>Zenith</ORGANIZATION> .</S>

<S>From the people who brought you hundreds of " yogic fliers " who claimed to defy nature by levitating comes <ORGANIZATION>The Natural Law Party</ORGANIZATION> , a minor political party that nominated a presidential candidate on Thursday .</S>
<S>At a hotel convention here , the party associated with the Transcendental Meditation ( TM ) movement named physicist <PERSON>John Hagelin</PERSON> as its presidential nominee for the Nov. 5 election .</S>
<S>The party is running on a platform claiming it can ward off problems before they occur through techniques such as mass meditation that would reduce stress , crime , terrorism and even wars .</S>
<S>" Social stress can be reduced and problems such as crime and violence will automatically decrease , " said a party paper .</S>
<S>Many party members are practitioners of TM , which involves meditating to a repeated word or phrase , called a mantra .</S>
<S>Some advanced TM followers contend they can actually mediate to such a point that they fly .</S>
<S>But in a demonstration of " yogic flying " several years ago , critics said the people were merely bouncing off the ground from a sitting position .</S>

<S>Huge Windows 95 sales fail to meet expectations .</S>
<S><PERSON>Martin Wolk</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>SEATTLE</LOCATION> 1996-08-22</S>
<S>A year after its massively publicized introduction , <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft Corp.</ORGANIZATION>'s Windows 95 computer operating system has fallen short of the most optimistic expectations for the software giant and the industry .</S>
<S>Even though more than 40 million copies of Windows 95 have been sold , making it the fastest-selling new software ever , it would have been impossible for any product to live up to the unprecedented hype of the Aug. 24 , 1995 launch , when stores around the world opened at midnight to greet long lines of customers .</S>
<S>The <PERSON>Redmond</PERSON> , Wash.-based company spent tens of millions of dollars promoting the product with stunts that included buying the entire print run of the <ORGANIZATION>Times of London</ORGANIZATION> and lighting <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Empire State</LOCATION> building in a Windows color scheme .</S>
<S>But the product , delivered eight months late , has fallen short of its sales potential in part because <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> delivered a mixed message to business customers , analysts said .</S>
<S>" It didn't do as well as it could have , " said <PERSON>Rob Enderle</PERSON> , an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Giga Information Group</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>Scores of software and hardware companies that had hoped for a big boost in sales were disappointed when only a brief spike materialized .</S>
<S>" People who were expecting major coat-tails were somewhat disappointed , " said <PERSON>Scott Winkler</PERSON> , an analyst with <ORGANIZATION>Gartner Group</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>" It's not as though it hasn't had an impact , " he said . "</S>
<S>It just hasn't had the huge earth-shattering impact some people were looking for . "</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Symantec Corp.</ORGANIZATION> , which had been among the most bullish of software companies at the time of the Windows 95 launch , ended up posting disappointing financial results when retail sales of the operating system fell short of its projections .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Touchstone Software Corp.</ORGANIZATION> had to pay $ 1.3 million in cash and stock to settle a shareholders lawsuit brought after the company's sales failed to meet expectations tied to the Windows 95 launch .</S>
<S>Many software developers apparently saw their crucial holiday season sales suffer last year because store shelves were jammed with blue-and-white boxes of Windows 95 , resulting in a shortage of space for seasonal products , said <PERSON>Ann Stephens</PERSON> , president of <ORGANIZATION>PC Data Inc</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>To be sure , sales of Windows 95 and the accompanying Office 95 upgrade drove <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> sales up 46 percent last year to a record $ 8.67 billion and cemented the company's status as the industry's dominant company .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> executives say they are thrilled with the sales figures , and industry analysts estimate that by sometime next year , the installed base of Windows 95 will surpass that of the older version of Windows , now used on about 100 million computers worldwide .</S>
<S>But <PERSON>Enderle</PERSON> said the figure could have been even higher if <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> had done a better job of handling the huge demand for technical support from customers who were frustrated trying to install the system .</S>
<S>He and other analysts said corporate <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> adopted a go-slow approach because <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> already was promoting the new version of its high-end Windows NT operating system , expected to be available in stores in the next several weeks .</S>
<S>" <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft</ORGANIZATION> sent a lot of signals that NT was going to be the answer , " <PERSON>Winkler</PERSON> said . "</S>
<S>Many people began to believe that Windows 95 was being downplayed . "</S>
<S>But now that Windows NT 4.0 has been launched , <PERSON>Winkler</PERSON> and others believe only a relatively small proportion of corporate users will elect to pay the added software and hardware costs needed to use it instead of Windows 95 .</S>
<S>" Windows 95 is going to do great , " he said . "</S>
<S>The mistake people made was in thinking it was going to be a fast , sweeping change rather than a slow , building change . "</S>

<S><LOCATION>WASHINGTON</LOCATION> 1996-08-22</S>
<S>The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> said on Thursday it remained committed to migration accords with <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> and would continue to repatriate intercepted Cuban migrants who attempted to enter <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> territory illegally .</S>
<S>A <ORGANIZATION>State Department</ORGANIZATION> statement appeared in part a response to Cuban complaints that <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> was jeopardising the accords by failing to return some of the Cubans involved in recent illegal migration incidents .</S>
<S>" The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> reiterates its full commitment to the implementation " of the accords signed by the two countries in 1994 and 1995 , said the statement by spokesman <PERSON>Glyn Davies</PERSON> .</S>
<S>" The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> will continue to return Cuban migrants intercepted at sea who seek to enter the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> or the <LOCATION>Guantanamo Naval Base</LOCATION> illegally , " it said .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> would also take " prompt and effective law enforcement action " against alien smuggling and hijackings from <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> , it added .</S>
<S><PERSON>Davies</PERSON> told reporters the statement would be distributed in the Cuban exile community in <LOCATION>Miami</LOCATION> " to remind everyone of the importance of abiding by the accords and avoiding dangerous attempts to cross the straits " from <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Florida</LOCATION> .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Havana</LOCATION>'s complaints centred on an incident in which a boatload of emigrants capsized in the <LOCATION>Florida Straits</LOCATION> last week and two recent aircraft hijackings from <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>Sixteen of those picked up from the boat were returned to <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> but eight were taken to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and three to <LOCATION>Guantanamo Bay</LOCATION> , a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> base on <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> , until they emigrated to another nation .</S>
<S>The most recent hijacking , last Friday , involved three hijackers and the pilot of a small aircraft .</S>
<S><PERSON>Davies</PERSON> said on Tuesday the pilot could soon return to <LOCATION>Cuba</LOCATION> but <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> authorities planned to try the hijackers .</S>
<S>In an incident on July 7 , a Cuban <ORGANIZATION>interior ministry</ORGANIZATION> official hijacked a commercial plane and sought aylum at <LOCATION>Guantanamo Bay</LOCATION> .</S>

<S>In keeping with its pioneering image in the area of welfare , <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> was the first state to submit an administrative plan under the nation's new welfare law , Gov .</S>
<S><PERSON>Tommy Thompson</PERSON> said Thursday .</S>
<S>According to a new release from the governor , <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> submitted a plan to the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</ORGANIZATION> for administration of the new block grant system for welfare just minutes after President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> signed the measure into law Thursday .</S>
<S>" As the nation's leader in welfare reform , <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> is far ahead of the curve and ready to go under this new system , " <PERSON>Thompson</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>Still , the governor said the new law does not go as far as the state's own welfare reform program , dubbed W-2 .</S>
<S>He said that despite the new law , <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> will still require federal waivers allowing the working poor to acquire health care coverage from the state , a 60-day residency requirement for participation in the welfare program , and child support collections to go directly to custodial parents .</S>

<S>State and federal agents on Thursday sifted through the rubble of two predominantly black <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> churches that burned within minutes of one another late Tuesday and early Wednesday .</S>
<S>Both churches were in the <LOCATION>Mississippi</LOCATION> delta region of <LOCATION>Arkansas</LOCATION> , about 90 miles ( 145 kms ) southeast of <LOCATION>Little Rock</LOCATION> , and were located within three miles of one another .</S>

<S>Dutch post and telecoms group <ORGANIZATION>Koninklijke PTT Nederland NV</ORGANIZATION>'s ( <ORGANIZATION>Dutch PTT</ORGANIZATION> ) first half results came marginally below most analysts ' forecasts , giving scant grounds to adjust full year estimates , analysts said on Friday .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>PTT</ORGANIZATION> earlier announced an 8.5 percent rise in net profit for the first six months of 1996 to 1.209 billion guilders , a hair's breadth below the 1.210-1.236 billion forecast range .</S>

<S><LOCATION>China</LOCATION> copper stocks owned by state reserve - trade .</S>
<S><PERSON>Lynne O'Donnell</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>HONG KONG</LOCATION> 1996-08-23</S>
<S>Up to 100,000 tonnes of copper held in <LOCATION>Shanghai</LOCATION> bonded warehouses , confounding the world market as to its source and ultimate fate , probably belongs to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION>'s strategic state reserve , industry sources said on Friday .</S>
<S>Around 40,000 tonnes of the copper have already been moved to warehouses near the northern port of <LOCATION>Yingkou</LOCATION> , where some of the strategic stockpile was stored , they said .</S>
<S>Just who owns the copper is a question that has kept traders and industry analysts guessing since the metal was channelled into <LOCATION>Shanghai</LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION>China National Nonferrous Metals Import and Export Corp</ORGANIZATION> ( <ORGANIZATION>CNIEC</ORGANIZATION> ) in June and July .</S>
<S>It was unclear whether or not the 40,000 tonnes had cleared customs -- which would provide some concrete indication that the strategic reserve , administered directly by the central government's <ORGANIZATION>State Planning Commission</ORGANIZATION> , owned the copper .</S>
<S>Traders have said the reserve could negotiate concessions on duties -- three percent import tax and 17 percent value-added tax -- that made the copper prohibitively expensive otherwise .</S>
<S>But one source , the head of a <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> trading house , said it made no difference if the copper was customs cleared or not .</S>
<S>" If they spend all this money moving the copper to <LOCATION>Yingkou</LOCATION> , it will be sitting there for years , " he said .</S>
<S>" Once it arrives in <LOCATION>Yingkou</LOCATION> , it is subject to monitoring by the <ORGANIZATION>State Planning Commission</ORGANIZATION> , which has to give permission for any more movement ; it is out of the hands of traders , " he said .</S>
<S>Mystery has surrounded the <LOCATION>Shanghai</LOCATION> stockpile in recent months , with traders unsure not only of who owns it , but of its exact size and what its owner planned to do with it .</S>
<S>Trading sources generally agreed it would be cost-effective to take the copper back into a depleted central reserve as it had already served its purpose in taking advantage of long-term backwardation on the <ORGANIZATION>London Metal Exchange</ORGANIZATION> ( <ORGANIZATION>LME</ORGANIZATION> ) .</S>
<S>A backwardation occurs when the spot price of a metal is higher than the forward price .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>CNIEC</ORGANIZATION> lent around 85,000 tonnes of copper onto the <ORGANIZATION>LME</ORGANIZATION> between April and June 1995 on behalf of the state reserve , running the state stockpile down to 115,000 tonnes from 200,000 tonnes previously .</S>
<S>Traders in <LOCATION>Asia</LOCATION> said <ORGANIZATION>CNIEC</ORGANIZATION> could well have lent it to the market at around US$ 2,700 a tonne , and then paid somewhere between $ 2,200 and $ 2,400 a tonne when it started taking the metal back earlier this year .</S>
<S>This would have cleared <ORGANIZATION>CNIEC</ORGANIZATION> a healthy profit , which could then have been used to finance storage and other costs .</S>
<S>Word that <ORGANIZATION>CNIEC</ORGANIZATION> had offered the copper to European trading houses in a series of secret meetings unnerved an already jittery market .</S>
<S>Industry analysts <ORGANIZATION>Bloomsbury Minerals Economics</ORGANIZATION> ( <ORGANIZATION>BME</ORGANIZATION> ) said on Wednesday the motivation of the owners of the 85,000 tonnes , " whoever they are , is the most important short-term fundamental " in an already tight world market .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>BME</ORGANIZATION> repeated in its latest review rumours of involvement by <ORGANIZATION>Sumitomo Corp</ORGANIZATION> , with <ORGANIZATION>CNIEC</ORGANIZATION> said to be helping the Japanese trader unload its copper positions after it revealed in June losses of $ 1.8 billion in a decade of unauthorised deals .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Sumitomo</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>CNIEC</ORGANIZATION> have made no comments on the talk and Chinese traders said they know nothing of such an arrangement .</S>
<S>Traders in <LOCATION>Shanghai</LOCATION> said on Thursday they were unaware of movements out of the <LOCATION>Shanghai</LOCATION> bonded warehouses .</S>
<S>They reported more arrivals that were probably spot purchases .</S>
<S>They also expressed concern that the tonnage in bonded warehouses would move onto the domestic market .</S>
<S>But these concerns were irrelevant , a <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> trader said , despite a forecast that domestic Chinese copper demand could hit one million tonnes this year .</S>
<S>As with many commodities , " there is a desire ( by the Chinese government ) to keep a stockpile of the metal , " he said . "</S>
<S>You don't keep it to help industry , you keep it in case of emergency . "</S>

<S>Dutch champions <ORGANIZATION>Ajax Amsterdam</ORGANIZATION> faltered in their second league match of the season on Saturday losing 2-0 away at <ORGANIZATION>Heerenveen</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Ajax</ORGANIZATION> , who had a dismal series of pre-season results before beating <ORGANIZATION>NAC</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Breda</LOCATION> in their opening game , had the best of an entertaining first half but failed to break the deadlock .</S>
<S>Eight minutes after the interval , <ORGANIZATION>Heerenveen</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Romeo Wouden</PERSON> broke through the <LOCATION>Amsterdam</LOCATION> defence , left defender <PERSON>John Veldman</PERSON> standing and curled the ball beyond goalkeeper <PERSON>Edwin van der Sar</PERSON> into the <ORGANIZATION>Ajax</ORGANIZATION> net .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Ajax</ORGANIZATION> , without injured defenders <PERSON>Marcio Santos</PERSON> and <PERSON>Winston Bogarde</PERSON> and strikers <PERSON>Jari Litmanen</PERSON> and <PERSON>Marc Overmars</PERSON> , then stepped up the pace and looked certain to equalise .</S>
<S>But they left gaps at the back and on 73 minutes Danish striker <PERSON>Jon Dahl Tomasson</PERSON> rushed out of his own half , beat the <ORGANIZATION>Ajax</ORGANIZATION> defence and lobbed <PERSON>van der Sar</PERSON> .</S>
<S>The defeat means <ORGANIZATION>Ajax</ORGANIZATION>'s main title contenders <ORGANIZATION>PSV Eindhoven</ORGANIZATION> , who beat the champions 3-0 in the traditional league curtain-raiser , can go three points clear of their rivals if they beat <ORGANIZATION>Groningen</ORGANIZATION> on Sunday .</S>

<S><LOCATION>HARARE</LOCATION> 1996-08-24</S>
<S>The Zimbabwean government fired thousands of workers on Saturday for defying an order to end a strike which has crippled essential services and disrupted international and domestic flights .</S>
<S>The <ORGANIZATION>Public Service Commission</ORGANIZATION> ( <ORGANIZATION>PSC</ORGANIZATION> ) said in a statement that the workers -- including nurses , junior doctors , mortuary attendants , customs officers and firefighters -- would be barred from entering their workplaces on Monday .</S>
<S>" All civil servants who did not return to work at their normal working hours , and remained working for the full working day on 23 August 1996 , have been summarily dismissed ...</S>
<S>with immediate effect , " it said in a statement .</S>
<S>Union officials from the <ORGANIZATION>Public Service Association</ORGANIZATION> ( <ORGANIZATION>PSA</ORGANIZATION> ) were unavailable for comment .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Public Service , Labour and Social Welfare</ORGANIZATION> Minister <LOCATION>Florence</LOCATION> Chitauro told state radio her ministry had already begun recruiting other people to replace the strikers , sub-contracting some of the work to private firms .</S>
<S>The government had been threatening to fire the workers since the strike began on Tuesday , saying it was illegal .</S>
<S>But the strikers ignored the threat and vowed to stay on the streets until their demands for wage rises of 30 to 60 percent were met .</S>
<S>The stoppage has left essential services stretched with many hospitals handling only emergency cases under senior doctors with the help of army medical personnel and the <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>It has also disrupted flights .</S>
<S>Some internal services were cancelled , leaving tourists at the <LOCATION>Victoria Falls</LOCATION> resort stranded , and flights abroad were delayed .</S>
<S>The <ORGANIZATION>PSA</ORGANIZATION> said 80 percent of the country's 180,000 civil servants took part in the strike which is a rare challenge to President <PERSON>Robert Mugabe</PERSON> , who has been in power since independence from <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> in 1980 .</S>
<S>Opposition parties , civic organisations and private-sector unions have expressed support for the action and denounced the government's pay rises of up to eight percent for its workers .</S>

<S>A limelight-loving South African chief was in disgrace on Saturday after a prized skull he brought home from <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION> was identified as belonging not to his sacred tribal ancestor , but to a middle-aged white woman .</S>
<S>A forensic scientist who examined the supposed skull of 19th century King <PERSON>Hintsa</PERSON> , a chief of President <PERSON>Nelson Mandela</PERSON>'s Xhosa tribe killed in battle by the British , said it was in fact the cranium of a European woman .</S>
<S>Chief <PERSON>Nicholas Gcaleka</PERSON> , dressed in animal skins and full tribal regalia , journeyed to a wintry <LOCATION>Scotland</LOCATION> in February on a hugely publicised quest to find <PERSON>Hintsa</PERSON>'s skull .</S>

<S><PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> campaign busy making " news " .</S>
<S><PERSON>Laurence McQuillan</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>WASHINGTON</LOCATION> 1996-08-24</S>
<S>President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> has served notice he intends to be busy " making news " -- or at least doing things that look and sound like it in a campaign year .</S>
<S>With Democrats gathering in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> to start a convention on Monday to nominate him for a second term as president , <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> plans a steady parade of events designed to highlight his leadership and dim the glow of the just-concluded Republican conclave that gave a boost to rival <PERSON>Bob Dole</PERSON> .</S>
<S>After a week of carefully orchestrated events signing into law bills passed by the Republican-controlled <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> used his Saturday radio address to the nation to proudly " announce " a development in the war on crime .</S>
<S>" Sixty days ago I directed the attorney general to draw up a plan for a national registry of sex offenders , " <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> said . "</S>
<S>That plan has now reached my desk . "</S>
<S>" Today I am pleased to announce that we are following through on our commitment to keep track of these criminals , not just in a single state but wherever they go , " he said .</S>
<S>Actually , creation of such a registry was underway without <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> lifting a finger .</S>
<S>Attorney General <PERSON>Janet Reno</PERSON>'s report -- all nine pages of it , including footnotes -- offers only the interim services of the <ORGANIZATION>FBI</ORGANIZATION> until a formal registry on sex offenders has been established .</S>
<S>Two months ago , <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> announced he wanted an interim effort established .</S>
<S>Now , 60 days later , he had a chance to talk about it again .</S>
<S>It is an example of <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s strategic planning as he heads into the stretch drive for the Nov. 5 presidential election .</S>
<S>Such things do not happen by chance in the <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> <LOCATION>White House</LOCATION> , they are part of his political chess game .</S>
<S>In the past week <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> signed into law an increase in the minimium wage , a bill that makes it easier for someone with a pre-existing health problem to change jobs , and sweeping changes overhauling the nation's welfare system .</S>
<S>" <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> can look back on a week of remarkable achievement , " <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> said , without even a passing reference to the Republican majority in the <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>" <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> is on the right track offering more opportunity , demanding more responsibility , building a stronger community , the sense of shared values and stronger families , " he said in striking the theme of his coming week .</S>
<S>According to a senior campaign official , <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> " will be making a lot of news in the coming week -- something different each day . "</S>
<S><PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> departs on Sunday on a four-day train trip through <LOCATION>West Virginia</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Kentucky</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Michigan</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Indiana</LOCATION> while fellow Democrats are gathered in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>" He'll make news during the day ... and then at night the attention will go to the convention , " said the campaign official . "</S>
<S>We think it'll work really well . "</S>
<S>Although officials decline to say just what each day's " news " will be , the intent is to put a focus on <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> himself and not just those attending the party's convention .</S>
<S>Each day of the trip will have a late start , so that network television correspondents will be able to do live reports for morning programmes .</S>
<S>Campaign officials then hope the day's " news " event will be showcased on evening television news shows as a lead-in for that night's convention programme .</S>
<S>" We'll be concentrating ... on supporting the president as he is on the trip and making significant public policy statements related to some of his plans for the future , " said <LOCATION>White House</LOCATION> Press Secretary <PERSON>Mike McCurry</PERSON> .</S>
<S><PERSON>McCurry</PERSON> said that when <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> delivers his acceptance address on Thursday night to fellow Democrats and a national television audience , he will " set out a road map " for the nation's future -- one the president hopes guides him back to the <LOCATION>White House</LOCATION> for four more years .</S>

<S>Defence Minister <PERSON>Volker Ruehe</PERSON> said that German troops would stay on in <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION> next year as part of an international force to ensure the establishment of peace , a newspaper reported on Saturday .</S>

<S>" After the ( Bosnian ) elections ( on September 14 ) the troops will start being reduced from the beginning of October from 60,000 to about 20,000 .</S>
<S>A completely new and different mandate will be agreed for next year , " <PERSON>Ruehe</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>" The defence ministers will begin negotiations for this at the beginning of September at a <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> meeting , " he told the newspaper in an interview , excerpts of which were released ahead of publication on Sunday .</S>
<S>" But we must avoid giving the impression this peace deployment in former <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION> is being perceived in the long run as an occupation .</S>
<S>On the other hand we must prevent any return of war and massacres " he said .</S>

<S>Italian comics hope independence-joke's on <PERSON>Bossi</PERSON> .</S>
<S><LOCATION>ORVIETO</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> 1996-08-24</S>
<S>A group of Italian comics hope the joke will be on separatist leader <PERSON>Umberto Bossi</PERSON> next month when they lead the ancient Etruscan town of <LOCATION>Orvieto</LOCATION> in a mock split from <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Orvieto</LOCATION> mayor <PERSON>Stefano Cimicchi</PERSON> said the comics , including popular actor <PERSON>Roberto Benigni</PERSON> , would declare <LOCATION>Orvieto</LOCATION> " capital of <LOCATION>Etruria</LOCATION> " on September 15 -- the day <PERSON>Bossi</PERSON> plans a march across the north in favour of independence from <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>" We will then proceed with the annexation of <LOCATION>Sardinia</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Corsica</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION> , " <PERSON>Cimicchi</PERSON> told reporters on Saturday .</S>
<S>He said the city council would be " ironically present " when the comics made their proclamation on the same day <PERSON>Bossi</PERSON> has threatened to declare the birth of <LOCATION>Padania</LOCATION> , the name he has given to northern <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Orvieto</LOCATION> , located in <LOCATION>Umbria</LOCATION> between <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Florence</LOCATION> , was once the capital of <LOCATION>Etruria</LOCATION> , an ancient federation of 12 Etruscan towns .</S>
<S>" We want to pop some air out of this balloon of tension that has been blown up around September 15 , " <PERSON>Cimicchi</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>" We want to help turn down the rhetoric in a country that borders former <LOCATION>Yugoslavia</LOCATION> yet in which people are still talking about secession , " he added .</S>
<S><PERSON>Bossi</PERSON> has intensified his separatist rhetoric since his <ORGANIZATION>Northern League</ORGANIZATION> party's good showing in last April's general election , when it took 10 percent of the vote nationally .</S>
<S>He has recently dropped a drive for federalism , saying secession from <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION>'s wasteful and centralised bureaucracy is the only solution for northerners .</S>

<S>An Italian farmer accused of multiple homocide has confessed to mutilating the bodies of four women after having sex with them , the Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION>ANSA</ORGANIZATION> reported on Saturday .</S>
<S>It quoted the lawyer of <PERSON>Gianfranco Stevanin</PERSON> as saying the 35-year-old farmer confessed on Friday to a <LOCATION>Verona</LOCATION> magistrate that he had killed and mutilated the women .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>ANSA</ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON>Stevanin</PERSON> was unable to recall how he had killed the women , remembering only that he had found them " lifeless in his arms " after having sadmasochistic sex with them .</S>
<S><PERSON>Stevanin</PERSON> , arrested in 1994 and jailed for three years for assaulting an Austrian prostitute , is accused of murdering five women , three of whose bodies were found near his villa outside <PERSON>Verona</PERSON> between July and December 1995 .</S>
<S>Two of the corpses were identified but not the third , found headless and decomposed in a sack in a nearby canal .</S>
<S>Lawyer <PERSON>Cesare dal Maso</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>ANSA</ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON>Stevanin</PERSON> confessed to beheading and dumping the body of a fourth woman in the nearby <LOCATION>Adige</LOCATION> river .</S>

<S><LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> asks how paedophile suspect eluded police .</S>
<S><PERSON>Jeremy Lovell</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>BRUSSELS</LOCATION> 1996-08-24</S>
<S>Belgian police searched two more houses on Saturday for bodies in a child-sex scandal of murder , kidnapping and pornography that has sent a shockwave of revulsion throughout <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>Recriminations built up over how the scandal's central figure , convicted child rapist <PERSON>Marc Dutroux</PERSON> , managed to prey on children unhindered for so long .</S>
<S>In just over a week two young girls have been found dead , from starvation , two have been freed from a dungeon-like secret compartment and an international hunt has started for at least two others .</S>
<S>On Saturday investigators with dogs trained to find bodies searched one house at <LOCATION>Ransart</LOCATION> and one at <LOCATION>Mont-sur-Marchienne</LOCATION> -- both suburbs of the southern city of <LOCATION>Charleroi</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>Both houses are owned by <PERSON>Dutroux</PERSON> .</S>
<S>Belgian media speculated that <PERSON>Dutroux</PERSON> , charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment of children , must have had high level protection to molest youngsters .</S>
<S>They put forward no proof to support the speculation , but seized on a comment by chief prosecutor <PERSON>Michel Bourlet</PERSON> on Belgian television on Friday night that he would chase down everyone involved in the case " if I am allowed to " .</S>
<S><PERSON>Bourlet</PERSON> said between 300 and 400 paedophile porn video tapes had been seized , some of which featured <PERSON>Dutroux</PERSON> .</S>
<S><PERSON>Dutroux</PERSON> was charged a week ago after police rescued two young girls from a concrete dungeon in the basement of one of the six houses he owns in and around <LOCATION>Charleroi</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>Just a day later the national euphoria at the rescue turned to disgust as <PERSON>Dutroux</PERSON> led police to the bodies of two eight-year-old girls in another of his houses .</S>
<S><PERSON>Julie Lejeune</PERSON> and <PERSON>Melissa Russo</PERSON> , had been kidnapped in June last year .</S>
<S><PERSON>Dutroux</PERSON> said they starved to death nine months later .</S>
<S>He also admitted kidnapping two other girls , <PERSON>An Marchal</PERSON> and <PERSON>Eefje Lambrecks</PERSON> , a year ago .</S>
<S>The fate of the girls is unknown , but there has been speculation they were sold into prostitution in <LOCATION>Slovakia</LOCATION> or the <LOCATION>Czech Republic</LOCATION> where <PERSON>Dutroux</PERSON> was a frequent visitor .</S>
<S>Belgian police have visited <LOCATION>Bratislava</LOCATION> and will visit <LOCATION>Prague</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>Five other people have been arrested including <PERSON>Dutroux</PERSON>'s second wife <PERSON>Michelle Martin</PERSON> , charged as an accomplice .</S>
<S>The others have been charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment of children or are suspected of criminal association .</S>
<S>Dutch police are also holding a 74-year old Dutchman in connection with the disappearance of <PERSON>An</PERSON> and <PERSON>Eefje</PERSON> , although a spokesman said no direct link had yet been established .</S>
<S>At least part of the speculation in the Belgian media of high-level protection for <PERSON>Dutroux</PERSON> and his accomplices is based on leaked documents cataloguing a high degree of police bungling , incompetence and indifference .</S>
<S>Among the revelations are the fact that the gendarmerie was running a surveillance operation codenamed " Othello " against <PERSON>Dutroux</PERSON> in 1995 -- when both <PERSON>Julie</PERSON> and <PERSON>Melissa</PERSON> and <PERSON>An</PERSON> and <PERSON>Eefje</PERSON> were kidnapped .</S>
<S>They show that the gendarmes were aware that <PERSON>Dutroux</PERSON> was building cells in some of his houses for holding children , yet this information was either not passed on to other police forces searching for the missing girls or was overlooked when it was .</S>
<S>They also show that police investigating a theft visited <PERSON>Dutroux</PERSON> late last year at the house where <PERSON>Julie</PERSON> and <PERSON>Melissa</PERSON> were being held but accepted his word that the children's cries they could hear came from neighbours .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Justice</ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON>Stefaan De Clerck</PERSON> has admitted that mistakes were made and ordered an inquiry at the same time as stressing there were no indications of a cover-up .</S>
<S>There is also widespread disbelief that no one appeared to question how <PERSON>Dutroux</PERSON> , an unemployed father of three with no visible means of support , managed to own six houses .</S>

<S>A small team of engineers from <ORGANIZATION>Sun Microsystems Inc.</ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>JavaSoft</ORGANIZATION> unit said Sunday they have formed a new company , dubbed <ORGANIZATION>Internet Startup</ORGANIZATION> , to build Java infrastructure software .</S>
<S>The fledgling company , established in a ground-floor office here over the last two weeks , has received venture financing from <ORGANIZATION>Bessemer Venture Partners</ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION>Menlo Park</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Calif</LOCATION> ..</S>
<S><PERSON>David Cowan</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>Internet Startup</ORGANIZATION> founder and acting chief executive , is a general partner of <ORGANIZATION>Bessemer</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>The startup company's acting chairman is <PERSON>Jim Bidzos</PERSON> , the president of <ORGANIZATION>RSA Data Security</ORGANIZATION> , a unit of <ORGANIZATION>Security Dynamics Technologies Inc.</ORGANIZATION> as well as chairman of <ORGANIZATION>VeriSign</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Internet Startup</ORGANIZATION> , which opened its doors with about half a dozen initial employees , combines experience at <ORGANIZATION>JavaSoft</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Apple Computer Inc.</ORGANIZATION> , and <ORGANIZATION>Oracle Systems</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>" Java portends dramatic changes in the way we use the Internet , " said <PERSON>Hong Bui</PERSON> , vice president of engineering of the new company after serving as a senior engineer at <ORGANIZATION>JavaSoft</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>Java is a computer programming language introduced by <ORGANIZATION>Sun Microsystems</ORGANIZATION> in mid-1995 which has immediately captured the attention of the industry for its ability to operate across virtually all computer system in a relatively secure manner .</S>
<S>Just last week , <ORGANIZATION>Sun Microsystems</ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION>Silicon Valley</LOCATION> venture capital giant <ORGANIZATION>Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers</ORGANIZATION> said they had completed financing of a $ 100 million fund managed by <ORGANIZATION>Kleiner Perkins</ORGANIZATION> to fund startups developing Java technologies .</S>
<S>Java has been licensed by nearly 50 organisations , ranging from <ORGANIZATION>Microsoft Corp.</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines Corp.</ORGANIZATION> to the <LOCATION>Taiwan</LOCATION> government .</S>
<S><PERSON>Prasad Wagle</PERSON> , another former senior <ORGANIZATION>JavaSoft</ORGANIZATION> engineer who is among the founding engineers at <ORGANIZATION>Internet Startup</ORGANIZATION> , said the new company aims to build software infrastructure using Java to make networked applications ubiquitious .</S>
<S>One feature of the Java language is that small software programmes , known as " applets " because they are small applications , can be downloaded from the server computers at the centre of networks onto individual computers for use .</S>
<S>In this model , individual computer users can always gain access to the latest programmes and do not need to store more software than they are currently using on their computers at any one time , also saving costs of memory and storage .</S>
<S><PERSON>Chris Zuleeg</PERSON> , a veteran of <ORGANIZATION>Apple</ORGANIZATION> and a former <ORGANIZATION>JavaSoft</ORGANIZATION> marketing manager , is vice president of marketing at <ORGANIZATION>Internet Startup</ORGANIZATION> , whose Web site is www.internetstartup.com .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Bessemer</ORGANIZATION> has funded numerous Internet pioneers , including <ORGANIZATION>PSI Net</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>VeriSign</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Individual</ORGANIZATION> .</S>

<S>MOTORCYCLING - JAPANESE WIN BOTH ROUND <PERSON>NINE</PERSON> SUPERBIKE RACES .</S>
<S><LOCATION>SUGO</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> 1996-08-25</S>
<S>Teenager <PERSON>Yuuichi Takeda</PERSON> , racing in only his first season , outclassed the big names to win the first race in round nine of the world superbike championship on Sunday .</S>
<S><PERSON>Takeda</PERSON> , 18 , showed poise far beyond his years to overtake Australian <ORGANIZATION>Ducati</ORGANIZATION> rider <PERSON>Troy Corser</PERSON> , last year's championship runner-up , with four of the 25 laps left .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Honda</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Takeda</PERSON> was pursued past <PERSON>Corser</PERSON> by the <ORGANIZATION>Yamaha</ORGANIZATION> duo of <PERSON>Noriyuki Haga</PERSON> and <PERSON>Wataru Yoshikawa</PERSON> with <PERSON>Haga</PERSON> briefly taking the lead in the final chicane on the last lap .</S>
<S>But <PERSON>Takeda</PERSON> found one more spurt of power to just take the flag first with <PERSON>Haga</PERSON> second and <PERSON>Yoshikawa</PERSON> third .</S>
<S><PERSON>Haga</PERSON> had the consolation of recording the fastest lap at 147.159 kph .</S>
<S><PERSON>Corser</PERSON> , who crashed during practice on Friday , limped in fourth , four seconds behind <PERSON>Takeda</PERSON> with championship leader <PERSON>Aaron Slight</PERSON> of <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> 11 seconds behind the winner .</S>
<S>In the second race , <PERSON>Takeda</PERSON> again challenged strongly until the fifth lap from the end when he crashed while running second to eventual race winner <PERSON>Takuma Aoki</PERSON> .</S>
<S><PERSON>Aoki</PERSON> , the elder brother of reigning 125cc world champion <PERSON>Haruchika</PERSON> , had a race-long duel with <PERSON>John Kocinski</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> on a <ORGANIZATION>Ducati</ORGANIZATION> before taking the chequered flag .</S>
<S><PERSON>Kocinski</PERSON> led for the early laps before he was passed first by <PERSON>Aoki</PERSON> , who recorded the fastest lap of 147.786 kph , and then by <PERSON>Takeda</PERSON> .</S>
<S>With <PERSON>Takeda</PERSON> out of the race , <PERSON>Kocinski</PERSON> regained second place but he could not overtake <PERSON>Aoki</PERSON> .</S>
<S><PERSON>Haga</PERSON> again was the unlucky rider finishing third ahead of <PERSON>Slight</PERSON> with <PERSON>Corser</PERSON> in 10th place .</S>
<S>But the strong showing by the Japanese riders did not alter the championship table with <PERSON>Slight</PERSON> still leading on 280 points , followed by <PERSON>Corser</PERSON> with 269 and <PERSON>Kocinski</PERSON> with 254 .</S>

<S>South African fast bowler <PERSON>Shaun Pollock</PERSON> concluded his <ORGANIZATION>Warwickshire</ORGANIZATION> career with a flourish on Sunday by taking the final three wickets during the county's Sunday league victory over <ORGANIZATION>Worcestershire</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S><PERSON>Pollock</PERSON> , who returns home on Tuesday for an ankle operation , took the last three wickets in nine balls as <ORGANIZATION>Worcestershire</ORGANIZATION> were dismissed for 154 .</S>
<S>After an hour's interruption for rain , <ORGANIZATION>Warwickshire</ORGANIZATION> then reached an adjusted target of 109 with 13 balls to spare and record their fifth win in the last six games .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Warwickshire</ORGANIZATION> are currently in fourth position behind <ORGANIZATION>Yorkshire</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Nottinghamshire</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Surrey</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Yorkshire</ORGANIZATION> captain <PERSON>David Byas</PERSON> completed his third Sunday league century as his side swept clear at the top of the table , reaching a career best 111 not out against <ORGANIZATION>Lancashire</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Lancashire</ORGANIZATION>'s total of 205 for eight from 40 overs looked reasonable before <PERSON>Byas</PERSON> put their attack to the sword , collecting his runs from just 100 balls with three sixes and nine fours .</S>

<S>CRICKET - RUN-OUT GIVES <PERSON>LEWIS</PERSON> AND <LOCATION>ENGLAND</LOCATION> SLIM SATISFACTION .</S>
<S><LOCATION>LONDON</LOCATION> 1996-08-25</S>
<S><PERSON>Chris Lewis</PERSON> did his best to forget his controversial omission from the <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> one-day squad on Sunday but could not prevent <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> reasserting their dominance in the final test at <LOCATION>The Oval</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>A super piece of fielding by <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> , dropped as a disciplinary measure after arriving only 35 minutes before the start on the fourth morning , provided the only bright spot for <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> as the touring team batted on to reach 413 for five at the interval , a lead of 87 .</S>
<S>The solitary wicket to fall was <PERSON>Asif Mujtaba</PERSON> , run out for 13 attempting a second run to third man where <PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> was lurking with a point to prove .</S>
<S>There seemed scant danger until the <ORGANIZATION>Surrey</ORGANIZATION> player swooped on to the ball and returned off balance to county team mate <PERSON>Alec Stewart</PERSON> who whipped off the bails .</S>
<S><PERSON>Lewis</PERSON> , though , could not make similar waves with the ball as <PERSON>Salim Malik</PERSON> and <PERSON>Wasim Akram</PERSON> batted through the rest of the session with few alarms .</S>
<S><PERSON>Wasim</PERSON> rattled along to 30 not out , outscoring his partner who was unbeaten on 24 at the break , although the weather was again threatening to play the dominant role .</S>
<S>Rain arrived just as the players left the field for lunch , forcing the ground-staff into action yet again .</S>
<S>The weather delayed the resumption for over an hour , the umpires finally announcing play would start again at 1445 local time ( 1345 GMT ) .</S>

<S><ORGANIZATION>Porto</ORGANIZATION> , who are fighting to take their third consecutive title this season , were 2-0 down until the 86th minute when a header by <PERSON>Mario Jardel</PERSON> found the net after a string of missed opportunities , including a penalty taken by top league scorer <PERSON>Domingos Oliveira</PERSON> in the 60th minute .</S>

<S>Argentine striker <PERSON>Gabriel Batistuta</PERSON> gave <ORGANIZATION>Fiorentina</ORGANIZATION> the perfect 70th birthday present on Sunday with two goals that gave the Italian Cup winners a 2-1 Supercup victory over serie A champions <ORGANIZATION>Milan</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>The victory , coming on the eve of the founding of the <LOCATION>Florence</LOCATION> club in 1926 , also marked the first time since the pre-season trophy between the Cup winners and league champions was started in 1988 that the Cup winners had won .</S>
<S><PERSON>Batistuta</PERSON> gave <ORGANIZATION>Fiorentina</ORGANIZATION> the lead in the 11th minute .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Stefan Schwarz</PERSON> picked him out with a lob to the edge of the box and <PERSON>Batistuta</PERSON> did the rest , chipping veteran defender <PERSON>Franco Baresi</PERSON> and scoring at the near post .</S>
<S>Montenegrin midfielder <PERSON>Dejan Savicevic</PERSON> equalised for the home team , weaving past a defender , checking and firing in a left-footed shot in the 21st minute that gave young <ORGANIZATION>Fiorentina</ORGANIZATION> goalkeeper <PERSON>Francesco Toldo</PERSON> little chance .</S>
<S>The scored stayed level to the final minutes but with a penalty shoot out looming , <PERSON>Batistuta</PERSON> took charge .</S>
<S>French international midfielder <PERSON>Marcel Desailly</PERSON> fouled the Argentine , whose coach at <ORGANIZATION>Boca Juniors</ORGANIZATION> before he joined <ORGANIZATION>Fiorentina</ORGANIZATION> in 1991 was new <ORGANIZATION>Milan</ORGANIZATION> coach <PERSON>Oscar Tabarez</PERSON> , and <PERSON>Batistuta</PERSON> rammed home the free kick from 30 metres out .</S>
<S>The 83rd minute shot , curling over the defence and dipping in under the bar from the striker dubbed <PERSON>Batigol</PERSON> by adoring <ORGANIZATION>Fiorentina</ORGANIZATION> fans , was just reward for <ORGANIZATION>Fiorentina</ORGANIZATION> who looked a far more impressive team .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Milan</ORGANIZATION>'s player of the year <PERSON>George Weah</PERSON> missed a good first half opportunity but otherwise looked a little rusty while Italian team mate <PERSON>Roberto Baggio</PERSON> did not play due to injury .</S>
<S>New Dutch signing <PERSON>Edgar Davids</PERSON> came on late in the second half as a <ORGANIZATION>Milan</ORGANIZATION> substitute but made little impact .</S>
<S>The league season starts on September 8 .</S>

<S><LOCATION>PRETORIA</LOCATION> , Aug 25 - Captain <PERSON>Sean Fitzpatrick</PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION>All Blacks</ORGANIZATION> revisited the test venue today to relive some of the magic moments of yesterday's momentous rugby victory over <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> , <ORGANIZATION>NZPA</ORGANIZATION> reported .</S>
<S>Most of the test 15 who beat the <ORGANIZATION>Springboks</ORGANIZATION> 33-26 to secure <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>'s first-ever rugby series in <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> stood in the middle of the empty 50,000-seat <LOCATION>Loftus Versfeld</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>Magnificent , ' ' said <PERSON>Fitzpatrick</PERSON> , <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION>'s most capped player and the world's most capped forward .</S>
<S>The players relived the moves and tries , the tackles and what might have been as the emotions of victory continued .</S>
<S><PERSON>Zinzan Brooke</PERSON> , the only No 8 in test rugby to have scored a dropped goal when he kicked a three-pointer against <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> during last year's World Cup , added a second to his name yesterday .</S>
<S>I was right here , ' ' he said standing at the spot where he had received the ball for the kick .</S>
<S>The maul was there and I was going to go in but I thought I should hold off because we had the ball .</S>
<S>When ( halfback ) <PERSON>Justin Marshall</PERSON> got the ball he was going to go on the openside where <PERSON>Jon Preston</PERSON> was so I emptied my lung at him to get the ball this way .</S>
<S>I just hit through and I was punching the air before the ball got there .</S>
<S>It cost me a few bucks at the bar . '</S>
<S>The decision to attempt a dropped goal was a spontaneous one , <PERSON>Brooke</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>It was just like the World Cup , the ball came and the chance was there . '</S>
<S>Centre <PERSON>Frank Bunce</PERSON> said he had never felt so exhausted during a match .</S>
<S>We were gutted and there was nowhere to hide , they just kept coming at you , ' ' he said .</S>
<S>I was gone in the first 20 minutes , completely exhausted , but you had no choice .</S>
<S>There was just so much riding on it .</S>
<S>It's amazing just how big this ground was yesterday . '</S>
<S>Two-try winger <PERSON>Jeff Wilson</PERSON> said he was so tired that he kept asking <PERSON>Bunce</PERSON> where he should be while defending .</S>
<S>He told me I'm buggered too so just hang in there ' , ' ' <PERSON>Wilson</PERSON> recalled .</S>
<S>About 4000 New Zealander supporters were partying into the early hours of today in the South African capital .</S>
<S>Messages of goodwill continued to roll into the team hotel .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>All Blacks</ORGANIZATION> coach <PERSON>John Hart</PERSON> said Prime Minister <PERSON>Jim Bolger</PERSON> rang him today to offer his congratulations .</S>

<S><LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> yet to hear from apartheid enforcers .</S>
<S><PERSON>Anton Ferreira</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>CAPE TOWN</LOCATION> 1996-08-25</S>
<S><LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s truth commission begins issuing subpoenas this week in a bid to dig beneath the political rationales and find the sinister figures who have the blood of the country's race war on their hands .</S>
<S>Leaders of the major parties involved , from right-wing whites to radical blacks , appeared before Archbishop <PERSON>Desmond Tutu</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Truth and Reconciliation Commission</ORGANIZATION> last week to paint the broad picture of their actions for or against apartheid .</S>
<S>Most , including former president <PERSON>F.W. de Klerk</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>African National Congress</ORGANIZATION> Deputy President <PERSON>Thabo Mbeki</PERSON> , offered apologies for any mistakes they had made and accepted broad responsibility for the actions of their foot soldiers .</S>
<S>But none named those guilty of ordering or carrying out any of the gross violations of human rights which <PERSON>Tutu</PERSON> is investigating .</S>
<S>Human rights lawyer <PERSON>Brian Currin</PERSON> said the hearings last week were not intended as a form of confessional and that those who personally committed crimes during apartheid would testify only before a separate arm of the commission , the amnesty committee .</S>
<S>" I don't think one should have expected more than what one got , " he said . "</S>
<S>That was not the amnesty committee where perpetrators are expected to open their hearts and souls and to tell it all . "</S>
<S>The commission , which has the power to grant amnesty to those who confess to abuses , has begun hearing the testimony from people already in jail for their deeds .</S>
<S>But others , such as self-confessed secret police hit-squad leader <PERSON>Dirk Coetzee</PERSON> , have yet to testify .</S>
<S><PERSON>Tutu</PERSON>'s deputy chairman , <PERSON>Alex Boraine</PERSON> , told reporters the commission would begin issuing subpoenas to suspects who refused to appear voluntarily some time this week .</S>
<S>He added that former hardline apartheid president <PERSON>P.W. Botha</PERSON> could be among those called .</S>
<S>But <PERSON>Currin</PERSON> , who is advising several people regarded as perpetrators , said this was not the best way to achieve the commission's aims .</S>
<S>" A person can be forced to appear , but the only way one is going to get to the truth in its totality is if people feel it is a good idea to go to the amnesty committee .</S>
<S>At the moment this is not the case . "</S>
<S>He cited <PERSON>Coetzee</PERSON> , who was charged with murder after confessing in media interviews to dirty tricks .</S>
<S>His trial is due to start in December but the truth commission intends to decide on his amnesty application before that .</S>
<S><PERSON>Currin</PERSON> said the law had to be changed so all judicial prosecutions were automatically suspended for those who approached the truth commission .</S>
<S>Last week's submissions to the commission by the <ORGANIZATION>ANC</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>de Klerk</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>National Party</ORGANIZATION> and the right-wing <ORGANIZATION>Freedom Front</ORGANIZATION> of General <PERSON>Constand Viljoen</PERSON> left many South Africans unsatisfied .</S>
<S><PERSON>Boraine</PERSON> said the picture was incomplete because officers of the apartheid-era security forces had yet to make their scheduled , separate submission , but one black caller to a radio talk show declared :</S>
<S>" This whole thing is utterly useless , it doesn't help us at all .</S>
<S>What the people expect is to have houses , to have jobs . "</S>
<S>Political scientist <PERSON>Jannie Gagiano</PERSON> said he doubted that the <ORGANIZATION>National Party</ORGANIZATION> , which implemented apartheid in 1948 and began dismantling it in 1990 , felt it carried a burden of guilt and needed to be exculpated through the commission .</S>
<S>" Therefore I have some doubts about achieving some form of reconciliation .</S>
<S>One has to feel a bit guilty to feel the need for reconciling yourself to a historical adversary , " he said .</S>
<S>Professor <PERSON>Tom Lodge</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>University of the Witwatersrand</ORGANIZATION> demurred , saying :</S>
<S>" In the irritation , in the jokes , in the anger that white South Africans express about the commission , I think there's a moral uneasiness , and I think that's healthy .</S>
<S>Responsibility is percolating downwards . "</S>

<S>Moslem refugees seek to vote in Serb-held town .</S>
<S><PERSON>Samir Arnaut</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>MATUZICI</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION> 1996-08-25</S>
<S>Thousands of Moslem refugees denounced <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION>'s elections as a farce on Sunday because Serb incomers would be able to vote in their old home town , cementing partition of the country .</S>
<S>They said they were ready to force their way back across post-war ethnic lines to Serb-held <LOCATION>Doboj</LOCATION> , one of several towns where <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> troops fear violence involving refugees determined to vote where they once lived .</S>
<S>The refugees , rallying in <LOCATION>Matuzici</LOCATION> on government territory two km from <LOCATION>Doboj</LOCATION> in northeast <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION> , waved banners calling the polls a farce staged by the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>European Union</ORGANIZATION> . "</S>
<S>We demand to vote in <LOCATION>Doboj</LOCATION> , " other banners said .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION>'s Moslem-led central government and many displaced Moslems are angered by a key provision of the Western-organised September 14 elections allowing people to vote in post-war " new places of residence . "</S>
<S>As a result , separatist Serb authorities have packed former Moslem majority towns with refugees of their own or registered other Serbs to vote there .</S>
<S>Critics say that what was billed as an electoral process to reintegrate <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION> as a single , multi-ethnic state is shaping up as a referendum on partition , de facto or de jure .</S>
<S>" Only our physical presence in <LOCATION>Doboj</LOCATION> will mean that the <LOCATION>Dayton</LOCATION> peace treaty has truly been implemented , " <PERSON>Edhem Efendija Camdzic</PERSON> , <LOCATION>Doboj</LOCATION>'s Islamic imam-in-exile , told the refugees .</S>
<S>" The main point of this rally is to highlight to the world powers what misfortune they brought upon us , " said <PERSON>Reuf Mehemdagic</PERSON> , head of <LOCATION>Doboj</LOCATION> municipality-in-exile .</S>
<S>" Eleven thousand Serbs who came from elsewhere to <LOCATION>Doboj</LOCATION> will vote there .</S>
<S>How can we then expect the reintegration of <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION> ?</S>
<S>But no one will stop us from returning to our homes . "</S>
<S><PERSON>Mirhunisa Komarica</PERSON> , a government refugee official , said : " We want to vote where we were thrown out from .</S>
<S>This is a protest of warning and the next step is entering our town using all means possible , so let them shoot . "</S>
<S>Bosnian Vice President <PERSON>Ejup Ganic</PERSON> , a Moslem , told the refugees : " We have a message for the Serbs who are now in our homes not to plan the future of their children there because there will be no good fortune in that . "</S>
<S>To loud applause , he added : " We will enter <LOCATION>Doboj</LOCATION> , untie the <LOCATION>Doboj</LOCATION> knot and ensure free movement for all .</S>
<S>We have to enter <LOCATION>Doboj</LOCATION> to free the Serbs from their own ( separatist ) politics . "</S>
<S>The <LOCATION>Dayton</LOCATION> peace accords guaranteed refugees the right to return to their homes and ensured freedom of movement across ethnic lines .</S>
<S>But local police , controlled by nationalist parties in Moslem , Serb and Croat sectors of <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION> , and civilian mobs have turned ceasefire lines into virtually impassable borders .</S>
<S>The majority of refugees from <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION>'s 1992-95 war are Moslems from the Serb-controlled north and east .</S>
<S>NATO-led peace troops beefed up their presence in the <LOCATION>Doboj</LOCATION> area on Sunday to deter any sudden emotional attempt by the refugees to cross the <LOCATION>Inter-Entity Boundary Line</LOCATION> into <LOCATION>Doboj</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>But the crowd dispersed without incident .</S>
<S>Moslems and Serbs have scuffled several times along the line in the past when Moslem refugees tried to surge into the town .</S>

<S>Leftist Mexican armed group says troops in capital .</S>
<S><LOCATION>MEXICO CITY</LOCATION> 1996-08-25</S>
<S>The leftist <ORGANIZATION>Popular Revolutionary Army</ORGANIZATION> ( <ORGANIZATION>EPR</ORGANIZATION> ) in a published report on Sunday said it operated throughout <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> , including the capital , and denied government assertions it was isolated to one state .</S>
<S>Commanders " <PERSON>Vicente</PERSON> " and " <PERSON>Oscar</PERSON> " , guarded by a dozen <ORGANIZATION>EPR</ORGANIZATION> gunmen , said in an interview with <ORGANIZATION>La Jornada</ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION>Mexico City</LOCATION> that the armed group was committed to overthrowing the government .</S>
<S>" They ( government officials ) want to present us before public opinion as a local problem , as just being from <LOCATION>Guerrero</LOCATION> and as irrational radicals , " Commander <PERSON>Oscar</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>La Jornada</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>They said the <ORGANIZATION>ERP</ORGANIZATION> , whose fighters first appeared wearing military fatigues and brandishing assault rifles in the southwestern state of <LOCATION>Guerrero</LOCATION> on June 28 , had a 23,000-strong membership , but this could not be confirmed independently .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>La Jornada</ORGANIZATION> also reported on Sunday that the <ORGANIZATION>Mexican Army</ORGANIZATION> has discovered a 37-page , <ORGANIZATION>EPR</ORGANIZATION> manual detailing guerrilla tactics and strategies .</S>
<S>It quoted the manual as saying : " The objective of the Basic Course on War is to provide for combatants of the <ORGANIZATION>EPR</ORGANIZATION> basic military knowledge for the armed conflict against the police and military apparatus of the bourgeoisie . "</S>
<S>It was the second time armed " commanders " of the <ORGANIZATION>EPR</ORGANIZATION> have granted interviews outside <LOCATION>Guerrero</LOCATION> state , an extremely poor and volatile region where leftist protesters often have clashed violently with authorities .</S>
<S>Unlike the better known and unrelated <ORGANIZATION>Zapatista</ORGANIZATION> rebels in southeastern <LOCATION>Chiapas</LOCATION> state , the <ORGANIZATION>EPR</ORGANIZATION> has never taken on the army in direct combat , according to official reports .</S>
<S>There have only been a few skirmishes in <LOCATION>Guerrero</LOCATION> in which a handful of police , soldiers and civilians have been killed or injured .</S>

<S>Two Thai border policemen were seriously wounded on Sunday when members of a Burmese rebel splinter faction ambushed their patrol in northwest <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> , security officers said .</S>
<S>The two were wounded in the early hours of Sunday when some 30 members of the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Karen Buddhist Army</ORGANIZATION> ( <ORGANIZATION>DKBA</ORGANIZATION> ) ambushed their patrol on the Thai side of the border with <LOCATION>Burma</LOCATION> , to the north of the town of <LOCATION>Mae Sot</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>The Thai army commander in the area , Col <PERSON>Suvit Maenmuan</PERSON> , told reporters the <ORGANIZATION>DKBA</ORGANIZATION> , which is allied with the <LOCATION>Rangoon</LOCATION> military government and based in southeast <LOCATION>Burma</LOCATION> , had recently stepped up cross-border infiltration .</S>
<S><PERSON>Suvit</PERSON> said the motive for their intrusions was not clear but he had ordered reinforcements to beef up security along the porous frontier .</S>
<S>The <ORGANIZATION>DKBA</ORGANIZATION> was formed in late 1994 by hundreds of guerrillas who split from the anti-Rangoon <ORGANIZATION>Karen National Union</ORGANIZATION> ( <ORGANIZATION>KNU</ORGANIZATION> ) and allied themselves with Burmese government army , their former enemies .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>DKBA</ORGANIZATION> members have since launched intermittent cross-border attacks on Karen refugee camps in <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> , where the majority of inhabitants are <ORGANIZATION>KNU</ORGANIZATION> supporters , and on Thai villages and police posts near the border .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Bangkok</LOCATION> has complained to <LOCATION>Rangoon</LOCATION> about the raids but Burmese military authorities say they have no contol over the faction .</S>
<S>Thai army commanders reject the explanation , saying they have evidence the Burmese army supplies and directs the renegade ethnic minority splinter faction .</S>

<S>Archaeologists in <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> have found pots used by ancient Egyptians in burial rites that they say may reveal the secrets of mummification .</S>
<S><PERSON>Mohammed Saleh</PERSON> , director of the Egyptian Museum , told <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION> television a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> team found the pots , some of which contain human intestines , in a tomb built into the rocks while digging in <LOCATION>Dahshour</LOCATION> , a village 40 km ( 25 miles ) south of <LOCATION>Cairo</LOCATION> .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Dahshour</LOCATION> is the site of <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION>'s second largest pyramid , built for the pharaoh <PERSON>Seneferu</PERSON> more than 4,500 years ago .</S>
<S><PERSON>Saleh</PERSON> said the team -- from <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Metropolitan Museum</LOCATION> -- found four Canopic jars and two unguent jars in the tomb , which belongs to an unidentifed person who lived during the 12th Dynasty ( 1991-1786 BC ) in the <LOCATION>Middle Kingdom</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>" This finding is important because one of the jars still contains substances and materials used in the conservation of mummies and the conservation of the intestines and all the things which were in the cavity of a person we have not identified yet , " <PERSON>Saleh</PERSON> said .</S>

<S>Israeli president invites <PERSON>Arafat</PERSON> to home - paper .</S>

<S>Israeli President <PERSON>Ezer Weizman</PERSON> has invited <PERSON>Yasser Arafat</PERSON> to meet him at his private home , <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>'s biggest newspaper said on Sunday .</S>
<S>The <ORGANIZATION>Yedioth Ahronoth</ORGANIZATION> daily reported that Prime Minister <PERSON>Benjamin Netanyahu</PERSON> , who has said he has no desire to hold talks with the Palestinian president , opposes the meeting due to be held this coming week .</S>
<S>The newspaper said <PERSON>Weizman</PERSON> scheduled the meeting at his private residence in the central Israeli village of <LOCATION>Caesarea</LOCATION> after <PERSON>Arafat</PERSON> sent him an emotional appeal " to save the peace process " .</S>

<S>Corporate <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> taking new view on compensation .</S>
<S><PERSON>Anne Murray</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>NEW YORK</LOCATION> 1996-08-23</S>
<S>Corporate <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> is planning major changes in employee compensation in the next few years , according to a recent study .</S>
<S>What it comes down to is this : If you're highly skilled , you'll benefit nicely .</S>
<S>But if you're not and cannot contribute to your employer's goals , you'll be paid less .</S>
<S>The survey , conducted in late 1995 and the early part of this year by management consulting firm <ORGANIZATION>Towers Perrin</ORGANIZATION> , showed that the focus will be on an employee's overall value to the company's bottom line -- rather than how well an employee performs a specific task .</S>
<S>Presently , for example , if an accountant's job involves doing five specific tasks , he or she can expect a certain salary , said <PERSON>Sandra O'Neal</PERSON> , a <ORGANIZATION>Towers Perrin</ORGANIZATION> principal .</S>
<S>In the future , the accountant will be evaluated solely on " knowledge , skill and abilities , " she said .</S>
<S>In addition to using accounting skills , the accountant will also have to be creative , work well in a team , be sensitive to customer needs and set productivity goals .</S>
<S>" The good news is , if you're highly skilled and have many abilities , you'll be paid more , " said <PERSON>O'Neal</PERSON> .</S>
<S>" The bad news is , if you're not skilled and can't contribute to a team , to customer service and the organisation's goals , you'll be paid less . "</S>
<S>Of the 750 mid-to-large size corporations surveyed , 81 percent had undergone a major restructuring in the last three years , and more than two-thirds reported that productivity and profits were up as result .</S>
<S>Next on the agenda for these firms is developing a new compensation structure , and 78 percent report that they are considering a new , skills-based plan for both management and non-management employees .</S>
<S>This coming shift , <PERSON>O'Neal</PERSON> said , " is not just isolated or a fad .</S>
<S>It's an inexorable change . "</S>
<S>After World War II , corporations adopted a " military model " creating hierarchical organisations where " the concept of defined tasks worked great , " she said .</S>
<S>But as the economy became global , customers were more demanding and problems became more complex .</S>
<S>" Multi-layers kept management at a distance from its customers , " <PERSON>O'Neal</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>Now organisations must change to stay competitive .</S>
<S><PERSON>O'Neal</PERSON> says firms will place a greater emphasis on teams and team performance in giving raises .</S>
<S>If your team does well , you'll do well .</S>
<S>If it doesn't do well , don't expect a raise .</S>
<S>Is this fair to an employee who can go the distance but is on a team that can't keep up ?</S>
<S>" That's an important question we used to ask a lot , " said <PERSON>O'Neal</PERSON> . "</S>
<S>It's not a question we ask any more .</S>
<S>The more important question is -- ' Do we have results ? '</S>
<S>To get those results , 27 percent of the companies surveyed plan to eliminate base pay increases in favour of cash bonuses and incentives , such as employee and team award programmes and education .</S>
<S>Companies that can change their culture and view employees as business partners will do well , <PERSON>O'Neal</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>For example , the survey rated some participants in the survey as " high-performing " companies , based on their return on equity above 16 percent .</S>
<S>Those companies also said they already offer employees variable pay and business education , give their managers more control over pay decisions and celebrate employee and team success .</S>
<S>" They respect employees more , they trust employees more and they value their employees more , " <PERSON>O'Neal</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>" The key to success at high-performance companies is engaging employees in a business partnership .</S>
<S>It will improve a company's bottom line . "</S>

<S><PERSON>Weinstein</PERSON> was found dead last weekend alongside the bodies of eight-year-olds <PERSON>Julie Lejeune</PERSON> and <PERSON>Melissa Russo</PERSON> in a house belonging to <PERSON>Detroux</PERSON> , who said they starved to death earlier this year , nine months after being abducted in June 1995 .</S>

<S>FEATURE - Fertile <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION> faces drought of cash and rain .</S>
<S><PERSON>Irene Marushko</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>BATKIVSHCHYNA COLLECTIVE FARM</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION> 1996-08-26</S>
<S>Four shiny new green-and-yellow <PERSON>John Deere</PERSON> combines parked at this 1,750-hectare ( 4,325-acre ) farm in the grain-growing regions south of <LOCATION>Kiev</LOCATION> don't fill its chief agronomist with enthusiasm .</S>
<S>" They did a good job this year , but they need good diesel and good engine oil , " said <PERSON>Ivan Odnosum</PERSON> . "</S>
<S><PERSON>God</PERSON> help us if there is a breakdown , " he said of the machinery , loaned to the farm after the Ukrainian government bought it earlier this year .</S>
<S>The country's grain harvest this year is forecast to fall by more than 23 percent to only 28 million tonnes and two harsh factors are to blame .</S>
<S>A drought scoured the steppes in May and June , stunting the growing wheat .</S>
<S>And the farming sector , making the painful transition from Soviet central planning to a market economy simply has no money .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION>'s black soil is so fertile that a diplomat described it as " rich enough to grow rubber boots " .</S>
<S>But recently <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION> has been losing its reputation as a breadbasket of <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> , earned in the years before brutal forced collectivisation under Soviet dictator <PERSON>Josef Stalin</PERSON> .</S>
<S>" The wheat will not be of a good quality this year , " said <PERSON>Hryhory Borsuk</PERSON> , a scientist at the <ORGANIZATION>Mironivka Wheat Institute</ORGANIZATION> , run by the <ORGANIZATION>Ukrainian Academy of Agrarian Sciences</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>" The temperature on the ground reached 62 decrees Celsius ( 143.60 Fahrenheit ) this summer .</S>
<S>We've never seen anything so bad , " he said in an interview in his office , unlit since the government cut off electricity because of unpaid power bills .</S>
<S>The harvest is gathered in the dry areas , but rainfall in <LOCATION>Western Ukraine</LOCATION> has delayed harvesting there .</S>
<S>While <ORGANIZATION>Mironivka</ORGANIZATION>'s scientists , some unpaid for months , carry on developing new strains of wheat resistant to <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION>'s extreme continental climate , <PERSON>Borsuk</PERSON> said the lack of cash in <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION>'s agricultural sector is as bad as the drought .</S>
<S>Collective farms and <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION>'s nascent private farming sector have no money for fertiliser , no money for herbicides and pesticides , no money to repair old or buy new machinery , no money for fuel , and none to buy good seed .</S>
<S>This year's harvest is down from last year's 36.5 million tonne harvest , which in turn compares with 50 million tonnes in 1990 , the year before independence .</S>
<S>The decline is all the worse for people who recall wasteful Soviet times , when the <LOCATION>Kremlin</LOCATION> imported grain but priced bread so cheaply that people bought it to feed their pigs .</S>
<S>" Agriculture is very expensive , and there are no solutions to our problems on the horizon , " said <PERSON>Odnosum</PERSON> .</S>
<S>He said his farm , its 260 workers now readying the fields for winter wheat sowing , expected the land to yield 5.2 tonnes per hectare ( 2.5 acres ) but ended up with 3.9 tonnes -- still better than the national average of 2.11 tonnes per hectare this year .</S>
<S>" We did not have money for fertiliser , we're in debt for fuel , and we're borrowing diesel , " <PERSON>Odnosum</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>A few kilometres ( miles ) down the two-lane road which passes <PERSON>Odnosum</PERSON>'s farm , where the occasional horse-drawn buggy passes by , is the 1,700-hectare ( 4,200-acre ) <PERSON>Shevchenko</PERSON> collective farm , built next to a village still neat and tidy despite post-Soviet decay .</S>
<S>Chief Accountant <PERSON>Natalya Sypron</PERSON> said the collective is strapped for cash , earlier this year bartering 220 tonnes of grain for diesel to fuel six rickety grain combines and tractors badly in need of repairs and basic maintenance .</S>
<S>The average family earns 160-200 million karbovanets a year ( $ 800 - $ 1,000 ) -- but many have not been paid in months , <PERSON>Soprun</PERSON> said . "</S>
<S>People are working out of their own dedication . "</S>
<S><PERSON>Borsuk</PERSON> said the farm sector has two options : " We can sit down and cry , or we can do something . "</S>
<S>He said the government plans to increase the sowing of the winter wheat which will be harvested next year .</S>
<S>Planted in late summer and early autumn , the grain is <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION>'s largest export item and traditionally grows better than summer wheat in <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION>'s soil .</S>
<S>Further plans , he said , called for full provision of resources like fertiliser and herbicides for 25 percent of <LOCATION>Ukraine</LOCATION>'s arable land next year , for 50 percent in 1998 and 100 percent of the land in 1999 .</S>
<S>" If we follow this we'll be able to sell 10 million tonnes of grain by the year 2000 , " <PERSON>Borkus</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>The government has been trying to phase out huge subsidies to the farm sector , and in a move back to pre-Soviet days has given up to 50 hectares ( 124 acres ) of land to some 36,000 private farmers willing to go it alone .</S>
<S>Collective farms will last for the next few years , because most private farms now only produce enough to feed themselves with maybe a little extra to sell , said one private farmer : " In the future , maybe , but it's better not to hurry .</S>
<S>" Collectivisation brought us a lot of pain .</S>
<S>And it went too fast .</S>
<S>Privatising too quickly can also have a negative outcome . "</S>

<S><ORGANIZATION>Gencor</ORGANIZATION> swells profit despite setbacks .</S>
<S><PERSON>Melanie Cheary</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>JOHANNESBURG</LOCATION> 1996-08-26</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Gencor Ltd</ORGANIZATION> on Monday said it had swelled its year attributable profit and streamlined operations to strengthen it for the current financial year despite a variety of divisional setbacks .</S>
<S>Announcing the group's results for the year ended June 30 , chairman <PERSON>Brian Gilbertson</PERSON> said : " Happily the strong improvement in financial performance is not an illusion arising from the recent weakness of the rand relative to the dollar . "</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Gencor</ORGANIZATION> raised attributable earnings to 1,803 million rand from 1,003 million rand previously - in dollar terms an increase to $ 469 million from $ 279 million - and won despite the group's <ORGANIZATION>Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd</ORGANIZATION> posting dismal results .</S>
<S>" Not everything has gone well .</S>
<S>We've had substantial production difficulties at a number of our operations .</S>
<S>The most obvious one with the greatest effect on the corporation was at <ORGANIZATION>Impala</ORGANIZATION> where we had the furnace failure , " <PERSON>Gilbertson</PERSON> said .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Implats</ORGANIZATION> posted year attributable profit of 176 million rand from 281 million previously .</S>
<S>Not only did the company lock in 3.92 rand per dollar in February / March , but it suffered output losses due to a furnace shutdown last August .</S>
<S>The rand was last bid at 4.5350 against the dollar .</S>
<S>Nor was <ORGANIZATION>Implats</ORGANIZATION> the only operation to fail output targets .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Ingwe Coal Corporation Ltd</ORGANIZATION> was hit hard by heavy rains .</S>
<S>It forfeited nearly one million tonnes of production to flooding at its mines in <LOCATION>Mpumulanga</LOCATION> province .</S>
<S>But <PERSON>Gilbertson</PERSON> said the greatest gloom in the year came from the <ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION>'s blocking of <ORGANIZATION>Implats</ORGANIZATION> ' proposed merger with <ORGANIZATION>Lonrho Plc</ORGANIZATION>'s platinum interests .</S>
<S>" The big disappointment for the year was the failure of the platinum merger .</S>
<S>From <ORGANIZATION>Gencor</ORGANIZATION>'s perspective we are taking the position that it is not on , " <PERSON>Gilbertson</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>Looking ahead to the current financial year , he said that <ORGANIZATION>Gencor</ORGANIZATION> would boost earnings further .</S>
<S>" <ORGANIZATION>Gencor</ORGANIZATION> is well placed to take up the challenges of the future .</S>
<S>The group is soundly structured and prudently financed and is blessed with an excellent portfolio of world-class businesses .</S>
<S>I think we can look forward to further growth " .</S>
<S>Citing the disposal of <ORGANIZATION>Gencor</ORGANIZATION>'s stake in industrial holdings group <ORGANIZATION>Malbak Ltd</ORGANIZATION> for one billion rand among other smaller disposals , <PERSON>Gilbertson</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>Gencor</ORGANIZATION> had pruned its portfolio to concentrate on core assets .</S>
<S>" We've tried to clean up our overall portfolio by disposing of non-core assets .</S>
<S>The biggest of those was <ORGANIZATION>Malbak</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>Overall a very substantial pruning ...</S>
<S>leaving <ORGANIZATION>Gencor</ORGANIZATION> clearly structured along commodity lines , " <PERSON>Gilbertson</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>He added that the group still had about 85 million rand after tax invested in various shares , which were market for disposal when required .</S>
<S>Referring to <ORGANIZATION>Gencor</ORGANIZATION>'s increased 41.5 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION>Ingwe</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Gilbertson</PERSON> said the group would wait for coal shares to be cheaper before considering snapping up more .</S>
<S>" I think we would have liked to have more of <ORGANIZATION>Ingwe</ORGANIZATION> but it's the question of adding value .</S>
<S>When we bought the shares we bought ...</S>
<S>at quite a bit lower than the price is now ...</S>
<S>maybe if we just wait another few years for the next downturn in coal . "</S>
<S>Finally , <PERSON>Gilbertson</PERSON> said a growing proportion of <ORGANIZATION>Gencor</ORGANIZATION>'s income was coming from offshore and unlisted investments .</S>

<S><ORGANIZATION>Advanced Medical</ORGANIZATION> reported profits of $ 8.4 million on sales of $ 29.2 million in the quarter ended June 30 .</S>

<S><LOCATION>JOHANNESBURG</LOCATION> 1996-08-26</S>
<S>The tiny islands of the <LOCATION>Seychelles</LOCATION> failed to make soccer history at the weekend when they bowed out of the preliminary rounds of the African Nations Cup .</S>
<S>Trailing fellow <LOCATION>Indian Ocean</LOCATION> islanders <LOCATION>Mauritius</LOCATION> 1-0 from the first leg , they were held to a 1-1 draw at home on Saturday despite playing against 10 men for most of the match .</S>
<S>The 2-1 aggregate took <LOCATION>Mauritius</LOCATION> into the group phase of the qualifiers for the 1998 finals , and kept up the <LOCATION>Seychelles</LOCATION> ' record of never having won an official match in their 10 years of <ORGANIZATION>FIFA</ORGANIZATION> membership .</S>
<S>The <LOCATION>Seychelles</LOCATION> must have thought they were on course for a historic breakthrough when Mauritian midfielder <PERSON>Andre Caboche</PERSON> was sent off for a crude tackle in the 19th minute .</S>
<S>But the visitors responded to the setback immediately -- veteran striker <PERSON>Ashley Mocude</PERSON> scoring a minute later to give them a two-goal aggregate lead .</S>
<S>Although <PERSON>Danny Rose</PERSON>'s 50th-minute equaliser gave the Seychellois renewed hope they could not find the net again and were eliminated .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Mauritius</LOCATION> now play in group seven of the qualifiers against <LOCATION>Malawi</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Mozambique</LOCATION> and favourites <LOCATION>Zambia</LOCATION> .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Namibia</LOCATION> , who drew 0-0 with <LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION> in their first leg , won the second leg in <LOCATION>Windhoek</LOCATION> 6-0 to stretch their unbeaten run to eight matches and continue their remarkable progress on the African soccer stage .</S>
<S>They now play in group five with <LOCATION>Cameroon</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Gabon</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Kenya</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>German-based striker <PERSON>Bachirou Salou</PERSON> returned home to <LOCATION>Togo</LOCATION> to score the decisive only goal of their tie against <LOCATION>Congo</LOCATION> .</S>
<S><PERSON>Salou</PERSON> , who plays for <ORGANIZATION>MSV Duisburg</ORGANIZATION> in the Bundesliga , scored in the 53rd minute of Sunday's match in <LOCATION>Lome</LOCATION> for a 1-0 aggregate win which takes his side into group six , where they will meet <LOCATION>Liberia</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Tanzania</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Zaire</LOCATION> .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Ethiopia</LOCATION> needed a penalty shoot-out in <LOCATION>Addis Ababa</LOCATION> to overcome <LOCATION>Uganda</LOCATION> after a 2-2 aggregate scoreline .</S>
<S>Both legs ended 1-1 before <LOCATION>Ethiopia</LOCATION> won the spot kick decider 4-2 .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Uganda</LOCATION>'s elimination follows their humiliating 5-1 aggregate defeat by <LOCATION>Angola</LOCATION> in June's World Cup qualifying preliminaries .</S>
<S>The other preliminary round second leg match , between <LOCATION>Mauritania</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Benin</LOCATION> in <LOCATION>Nouakchott</LOCATION> , was postponed until Friday .</S>

<S>TENNIS - QUENCH YOUR THIRST - IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT AT U.S. OPEN .</S>
<S><PERSON>Bill Berkrot</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>NEW YORK</LOCATION> 1996-08-26</S>
<S>A message on television monitors all around the <LOCATION>National Tennis Centre</LOCATION> reads : " Due to hot weather please seek shade and drink plenty of fluids " -- sound advice until you check out the price of fluids .</S>
<S>Perhaps the advisory was cut off before concluding : " ...and bring plenty of money . "</S>
<S>A small bottle of a garishly-coloured sports drink at the sun-drenched U.S. Open is going for $ 3.75 , while a litre of basic , life-sustaining water will set you back $ 4.00 -- for water ?</S>
<S>" At the Olympics water was only a dollar , and that was the Olympics , " said one incredulous fan , noting that the Atlanta Games had been notorious for price gouging .</S>
<S>U.S. Open officials managed to insult most of the male tennis players last week with their controversial handling of the seeding and draw .</S>
<S>When the tournament began on Monday it was the fans ' turn to be offended .</S>
<S>" That baked lasagna better be good for $ 8.50 , " said New Yorker <PERSON>Rebecca Weinstein</PERSON> , a U.S. Open regular who was eating a sandwich she had brought from home .</S>
<S>A trio of hungry fans at the food court who had already forked over the lasagna money pronounced it good , but <PERSON>Carol Perry</PERSON> chimed in , " The water is ridiculous , they want four dollars for the water , you might as well get a glass of wine . "</S>
<S>Indeed , a nice glass of chardonnay or white zinfandel was going for $ 4.75 , while an imported beer was just a bit more than the water at $ 4.50 .</S>
<S>What's the message here ? "</S>
<S>Maybe they want us to be alcoholics , " <PERSON>Perry</PERSON> joked before lifting her glass of wine .</S>
<S>Fans will be shelling out $ 12.50 for a hamburger and a large french fries .</S>
<S>And that little snack is guaranteed to make you thirsty .</S>
<S>Make that $ 16.50 .</S>
<S>Even a sandwich as pedestrian as a ham and swiss cheese is going for a whopping $ 8.00 .</S>
<S>Of course , it is served on a tuscan roll .</S>
<S>It must be the cost of flying those rolls over from <LOCATION>Tuscany</LOCATION> every day that drives up the price of the sandwich .</S>

<S>TENNIS - <PERSON>HUBER</PERSON> AND <PERSON>MALEEVA</PERSON> FALL , UP-AND-COMERS ADVANCE AT OPEN .</S>
<S><PERSON>Larry Fine</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>NEW YORK</LOCATION> 1996-08-26</S>
<S><PERSON>Martina Hingis</PERSON> led a youthful charge and Australian Open finalist <PERSON>Anke Huber</PERSON> and <PERSON>Magdalena Maleeva</PERSON> were fallen seeds on Monday in a hot , sunny opening to the U.S. Open tennis championships .</S>
<S>The 15-year-old <PERSON>Hingis</PERSON> , seeded 16th , was honoured to play the first match of the season's last Grand Slam on <LOCATION>Stadium Court</LOCATION> but happy to hurry off with a straight-sets victory over the 112th-ranked <PERSON>Angeles Montolio</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>" It was very hot and I didn't want to stay long on the court , " said a cheery <PERSON>Hingis</PERSON> , who had no worries in racing to a 6-1 6-0 victory against the overmatched Spaniard .</S>
<S>Hoping for a longer engagement on the cement at <LOCATION>Flushing Meadows</LOCATION> were the sixth-seeded <PERSON>Huber</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> and 12th seed <PERSON>Maleeva</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Bulgaria</LOCATION> .</S>
<S><PERSON>Huber</PERSON> , who lost to <PERSON>Monica Seles</PERSON> in the Australian Open final , fell victim to an unfortunate draw in bowing to dangerous floater <PERSON>Amanda Coetzer</PERSON> of <LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION> .</S>
<S><PERSON>Coetzer</PERSON> , ranked 17th , avenged her defeat to <PERSON>Huber</PERSON> in the Australian Open semifinals by winning 6-1 2-6 6-2 .</S>
<S>" I looked at it as not a first round match , just a great challenge for me , " said <PERSON>Coetzer</PERSON> , 24 . "</S>
<S>I was really concentrating on keeping my own momentum and my own rhythm .</S>
<S>" She is tough to play in that way because she plays very up and down .</S>
<S>She played one great game and than a few errors .</S>
<S>The challenge was just for me to keep playing my own game . "</S>
<S><PERSON>Huber</PERSON> , who reached the final a week ago at <LOCATION>Manhattan Beach</LOCATION> , could only mourn her luck of the draw .</S>
<S>" I wasn't happy when I saw the draw .</S>
<S>She was the first non- seeded player , " said the 21-year-old German . "</S>
<S>It's always tough to play somebody like that in the first round in a Grand Slam .</S>
<S>" I think I didn't play that bad today .</S>
<S>It was maybe my best first round match in a Grand Slam I ever played . "</S>
<S>Monday brought the best out in U.S. Open rookie <PERSON>Aleksandra Olsza</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> , ranked 110th .</S>
<S>The 18-year-old <PERSON>Olsza</PERSON> , last year's Wimbledon junior champion , celebrated her debut in the main draw of the Open by removing <PERSON>Maleeva</PERSON> 6-4 6-2 .</S>
<S>The curtain-raising victories by <PERSON>Hingis</PERSON> and <PERSON>Olsza</PERSON> provided a ringing endorsement for the newest wave of women's players coming up from the junior ranks .</S>
<S>The Swiss teenager , a twice French Open junior champion and a Wimbledon juniors winner , had already proven her main stage mettle by reaching the quarters at this year's Australian Open .</S>
<S>" I hope I can get into the last 16 , " said <PERSON>Hingis</PERSON> , seeded to face third seed <PERSON>Arantxa Sanchez Vicario</PERSON> in the fourth round .</S>
<S><PERSON>Hingis</PERSON> has been working hard on conditioning and has lost eight pounds ( 3.5 kilos ) in advance of the championships .</S>
<S>" There will be tough matches but I hope I can get there , " she said . "</S>
<S>Then we'll see if <PERSON>Arantxa</PERSON> will be there , too . "</S>
<S>The fast-moving <PERSON>Olsza</PERSON> , 18 , was cool in her opening match .</S>
<S>" I wasn't scared when I heard that I was playing <PERSON>Maleeva</PERSON> , " said <PERSON>Olsza</PERSON> . "</S>
<S>I know that if I want to play professional tennis I have to do my best to try to beat her and I can't be scared . "</S>
<S><PERSON>Olsza</PERSON> is undaunted by the level of competition in the pros .</S>
<S>" In terms of tennis , I think the junior players are really good now .</S>
<S>In a few years , it could change a lot among the top players . "</S>
<S>Two big-serving women's players made quick work of Japanese opponents .</S>
<S><PERSON>Brenda Schultz-McCarthy</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION> , the 13th seed , was a 6-1 6-4 winner over <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Nana Miyaga</PERSON> , while Czech veteran <PERSON>Helena Sukova</PERSON> prevailed over <PERSON>Yone Kamio</PERSON> 6-2 6-3 .</S>
<S>Austrian <PERSON>Barbara Paulus</PERSON> , seeded 14th , also reached the second round with a 6-2 6-1 victory over <PERSON>Yi Jing-Qian</PERSON> of <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> .</S>

<S>TENNIS - <PERSON>STICH</PERSON> GLAD HE STAYED AFTER OPEN VICTORY .</S>
<S><PERSON>Richard Finn</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>NEW YORK</LOCATION> 1996-08-26</S>
<S><PERSON>Michael Stich</PERSON> nearly pulled out of the U.S. Open in protest over the men's seeding fiasco but the former Wimbledon champion was glad he stayed after sweating out a four-set win on Monday over qualifier <PERSON>Tommy Haas</PERSON> .</S>
<S>" I still feel it's embarrassing what happened and I was about to pull out yesterday and say , ' That's it , ' " said <PERSON>Stich</PERSON> , one of a host of men who cried foul over seeding procedures that forced an unprecedented remaking of the men's draw last week .</S>
<S>" But there are so many reasons to play , especially spectators and the kids who come out here and want to enjoy watching tennis , that I decided to stay . "</S>
<S>In a break from tradition , the Open did not seed in strict accordance with <ORGANIZATION>ATP</ORGANIZATION> rankings , instead taking into account other factors that raised objections of favourtism toward <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> players .</S>
<S>One prominent player that did not stay for the Open was French Open champion <PERSON>Yvegeny Kafelnikov</PERSON> , who after being dropped three spots from his <ORGANIZATION>ATP</ORGANIZATION> ranking to a seventh seeding , withdrew and returned home to <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> .</S>
<S><PERSON>Kafelnikov</PERSON> had pulled out of last week's tournament with a rib injury .</S>
<S>At a news conference attended by approximately 50 players on Sunday , <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Davis Cup player <PERSON>Todd Martin</PERSON> expressed the players ' outrage at the seedings .</S>
<S>" The way the U.S. Open has seeded here , tampering with the ranking system , has tarnished the image and reputation of this U.S. Open in the players ' mind , and we think that is damaging to our sport , " <PERSON>Martin</PERSON> said .</S>
<S><PERSON>Stich</PERSON> said he felt the players ought to have organised an active protest .</S>
<S>" I feel that we made it a little easy for the <ORGANIZATION>USTA</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>They didn't really get hurt as much as I think they should have , " said <PERSON>Stich</PERSON> . "</S>
<S>I feel that we should have maybe just cancelled out the Monday , not show up today and start the tournament tomorrow . "</S>
<S>But once the 27-year-old <PERSON>Stich</PERSON> got on the court , he focused his energies on trying to win the year's last Grand Slam .</S>
<S>He took a positive first step with his 6-3 1-6 6-1 7-5 win over compatriot <PERSON>Haas</PERSON> on a sun-baked Grandstand court .</S>
<S>Others advancing early on Monday included 11th-seeded American <PERSON>Malivai Washington</PERSON> , the Wimbledon runner-up , <LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Magnus Gustafsson</PERSON> , and two-time former French Open champion <PERSON>Sergi Bruguera</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> , who will be <PERSON>Stich</PERSON>'s next opponent .</S>
<S>The suspicion , however , lingers in <PERSON>Stich</PERSON>'s mind that U.S. Open officials did tamper with the seeding process in order to benefit homegrown players .</S>
<S>" I get the feeling that everything is done here for the American players and they forget about all the other players , " said <PERSON>Stich</PERSON> , who lost the 1994 Open final to <PERSON>Andre Agassi</PERSON> .</S>
<S>It was <PERSON>Agassi</PERSON> who was at the centre of the controversy that engulfed the tournament since the original draw was completed on Wednesday .</S>
<S>The flamboyant American star was bumped up two spots from his <ORGANIZATION>ATP</ORGANIZATION> ranking of eight to a seeding of six .</S>
<S>" He ( <PERSON>Agassi</PERSON> ) should be seeded the way he is playing tennis right now , " said <PERSON>Stich</PERSON> about the unfairness of moving up <PERSON>Agassi</PERSON> , who made early exits from the French Open and Wimbledon .</S>
<S><PERSON>Stich</PERSON> , not seeded here for the first time since 1990 , might have benefitted from some fiddling with the seedings himself after <PERSON>Kafelnikov</PERSON> withdrew .</S>
<S>Ranked 18th in the world , <PERSON>Stich</PERSON> might have been slipped into that spot ahead of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Felix Mantilla</PERSON> , who is 16th but had never been played in the Open and had been left out of the seedings originally .</S>
<S>But <PERSON>Stich</PERSON> didn't want to play that game .</S>
<S>" I think he deserves to be seeded as everybody else who is in the top 16 deserves to be seeded , " <PERSON>Stich</PERSON> said .</S>

<S><ORGANIZATION>OSCE</ORGANIZATION> delays decision on refugee voting .</S>
<S><PERSON>Kurt Schork</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>SARAJEVO</LOCATION> 1996-08-26</S>
<S><LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION>'s election organisers will decide on Tuesday whether or not to postpone municipal elections scheduled as part of nationwide balloting , an <ORGANIZATION>OSCE</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said on Monday .</S>
<S>Officials from the <ORGANIZATION>Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe</ORGANIZATION> ( <ORGANIZATION>OSCE</ORGANIZATION> ) are considering the postponement following allegations of serious irregularities in the registration of Serb refugees .</S>
<S>International observers say the alleged irregularities could affect the outcome of voting for municipal assemblies .</S>
<S>" Tomorrow ...</S>
<S>the <ORGANIZATION>Provisional Election Commission</ORGANIZATION> will consider the possible postponement of municipal elections only ...</S>
<S>the other elections will be held on September 14 , " <ORGANIZATION>OSCE</ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON>Agota Kuperman</PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION>Sarajevo</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>" I think that it would be very difficult to select which municipal elections would have to be cancelled .</S>
<S>I think probably if the decision ( to cancell ) were to be taken it would probably be all municipal elections ..</S>
<S><PERSON>Kuperman</PERSON> added that options other than postponement were also on the table , but she refused to specify what they were .</S>
<S>The <LOCATION>Dayton</LOCATION> peace agreement gave the <ORGANIZATION>OSCE</ORGANIZATION> a mandate to organise Bosnian elections .</S>
<S>The <ORGANIZATION>Provisional Election Commission</ORGANIZATION> is <ORGANIZATION>OSCE</ORGANIZATION>'s top rule-making body for the poll .</S>
<S>More than 600,000 refugees have registered to vote in 55 countries around the world , representing about 20 per cent of <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION>'s total electorate .</S>
<S>They are due to begin voting on Wednesday , August 28 , just one day after the <ORGANIZATION>PEC</ORGANIZATION> is supposed to make its decision .</S>
<S>Balloting inside <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION> is scheduled for September 14 , when citizens are slated to elect municipal and cantonal assemblies , separate Moslem-Croat and Serb parliaments , a national <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> and a three-man Presidency .</S>
<S>A <LOCATION>Sarajevo</LOCATION> daily newspaper , <ORGANIZATION>Dnevi Avaz</ORGANIZATION> , which is close to <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION>'s Moslem nationalist <ORGANIZATION>SDA</ORGANIZATION> party , on Monday said the <ORGANIZATION>OSCE</ORGANIZATION> would postpone the municipal-level elections until the Spring of 1997 because of the refugee registration problems .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>SDA</ORGANIZATION> has a representative on the <ORGANIZATION>Provisional Election Commission</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>" I don't know what the source of the <ORGANIZATION>Dnevi Avaz</ORGANIZATION> report is , but it is consistent with what I have heard from western diplomats and from inside the <ORGANIZATION>OSCE</ORGANIZATION> , " said an <ORGANIZATION>OSCE</ORGANIZATION> staff member in <LOCATION>Sarajevo</LOCATION> who asked not to be named .</S>
<S>" The word is that <PERSON>Frowick</PERSON> has decided to postpone municipal elections but that he will wait for one more session of the <ORGANIZATION>PEC</ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday to take everyone's temperature on the issue . "</S>
<S>Ambassador <PERSON>Robert Frowick</PERSON> , an American , heads the <ORGANIZATION>OSCE</ORGANIZATION> mission in <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION> .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>OSCE</ORGANIZATION> and independent monitors allege that Serb authorities have systematically discouraged refugees from registering to cast a ballot in the places they lived before the war .</S>
<S>Instead , the refugees were said to have been directed by their authorities to vote from strategic towns which had Moslem majorities before the 43-month Bosnian war , but which are now underpopulated as a result of " ethnic cleansing " .</S>
<S>Diplomats explain the purpose of this electoral engineering is to secure Serb control over pivotal towns inside the 49 per cent of <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION> known as the Serb republic , consolidating through the ballot box what was initially taken in war .</S>
<S>The top <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> refugee official in the <LOCATION>Balkans</LOCATION> highlighted the voter registration problem on Monday .</S>
<S>" Results of the registration for September elections herald a dismal future for multi-ethnicity in <LOCATION>Bosia-Hercegovina</LOCATION> , " warned <PERSON>Soren Jessen-Petersen</PERSON> , Special Envoy for the <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees in <LOCATION>Former Yugoslavia</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>" In the run-up to elections , nationalistic political leaders are playing the ethnic / sectarian card , drumming up support within their constituencies by playing on bitter memories or fear . "</S>

<S>After truce , <PERSON>Lebed</PERSON> faces tougher Chechen problem .</S>
<S><PERSON>Alastair Macdonald</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>MOSCOW</LOCATION> 1996-08-26</S>
<S><PERSON>Alexander Lebed</PERSON> may finally get to discuss his Chechen peace proposals with <PERSON>Boris Yeltsin</PERSON> on Tuesday after a lost weekend in the region when he was forced to abandon plans to sign a new political treaty with the separatist rebels .</S>
<S>It could be a sobering experience for the <LOCATION>Kremlin</LOCATION> security chief who , just two months after being appointed by the president and two heady weeks after taking charge of the Chechen crisis , had promised to wrap up the 20-month war by the weekend .</S>
<S>Despite a mood of compromise in the region after some of the worst fighting of the war , <PERSON>Lebed</PERSON> may be just finding out that concluding a long-term settlement , somewhere between rebel demands for independence and <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>'s insistence that <LOCATION>Chechnya</LOCATION> remain part of <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> , will be no easy matter .</S>
<S>A chain-smoking former paratroop general with a sharp line in deadpan putdowns and a soldier's knack for making life sound simple , <PERSON>Lebed</PERSON> managed to arrange an ambitious ceasefire in the region last week , days after the Russian army threatened to bomb its way back into the rebel-held Chechen capital <LOCATION>Grozny</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>He returned at the weekend , pledging to conclude a political settlement that would make this truce work where all others have failed .</S>
<S>But then he apparently thought better of it .</S>
<S>Saying he needed to tidy up legal loose ends on the deal -- and also cover his back against unnamed pro-war schemers in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> -- he flew back to the capital empty-handed on Sunday .</S>
<S>He met Russian Prime Minister <PERSON>Viktor Chernomyrdin</PERSON> on Monday and , according to the press service of <PERSON>Lebed</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Security Council</ORGANIZATION> , could meet <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> on Tuesday .</S>
<S>It was not clear if the start of <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s holiday , announced later , would affect plans to talk .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>'s as yet undisclosed proposals on <LOCATION>Chechnya</LOCATION>'s political future have , meanwhile , been sent back to do the rounds of various government departments .</S>
<S>It is not known what caused the delay in the peace plan .</S>
<S>Speculation mounted last week that <PERSON>Lebed</PERSON> was operating out on a limb in <LOCATION>Chechnya</LOCATION> as <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> , hardly seen since his reelection last month , kept out of sight and then gave an interview criticising his envoy just as he clinched a truce .</S>
<S>But <PERSON>Chernomyrdin</PERSON> took pains at the weekend to insist <PERSON>Lebed</PERSON> was playing for a united team and that the proposals he took to rebel chief-of-staff <PERSON>Aslan Maskhadov</PERSON> had been agreed by <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> .</S>
<S>If that were the case , it was unclear why <PERSON>Lebed</PERSON> suddenly found it necessary to have the deal verified in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> .</S>
<S><PERSON>Lebed</PERSON> himself said he was concerned that powerful interests in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> , who have profited from the war and want it to go on , would seize on any inadequacy in the deal to remove him .</S>
<S><PERSON>Maskhadov</PERSON> warned that <PERSON>Lebed</PERSON> risked the same fate as a former Russian army commander in the region who sought a compromise and was blown up last year by -- so the Chechens say -- Russian forces .</S>
<S><PERSON>Maskhadov</PERSON> may also have made new demands on <PERSON>Lebed</PERSON> , forcing him to check back with the <LOCATION>Kremlin</LOCATION> on what he could offer .</S>
<S>A rebel spokesman said the two military men had come close to agreement on a face-saving formula acceptable to both sides and involving a referendum on independence at some future date .</S>
<S><PERSON>Chernomyrdin</PERSON> said voters should decide <LOCATION>Chechnya</LOCATION>'s future but stressed there was no question of the government letting the region quit the <LOCATION>Russian Federation</LOCATION> -- something <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> fears could encourage separatist tendencies in other ethnic regions , particularly in the strategic <LOCATION>North Caucasus</LOCATION> .</S>
<S><PERSON>Lebed</PERSON> may be be finding that closing that political gap between the two sides is more difficult than just ending a war .</S>

<S>Thousands of workers of <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Zastava</ORGANIZATION> arms factory entered the second week of protests on Monday over unpaid wages and the lack of a programme to revive the plant's production .</S>
<S>" We are stubborn , have strength and time to persist until our demands are met , " said the factory's trade union secretary <PERSON>Dragutin Stanojlovic</PERSON> .</S>
<S>" We are united and we are waiting for the government to decide what to do with us . "</S>
<S>Trade unions demanded payment of June and July wages and last year's holiday pay , and called on government to develop a revival programme for the plant .</S>

<S>The ruling <ORGANIZATION>Socialist Party</ORGANIZATION> last week accused <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION>'s opposition of stirring up social unrest and using workers ' already difficult social position for their own interests .</S>
<S>" Late wages , no work and ( the lack of a ) production programme are the main reasons for their protests , " a senior member of the local <ORGANIZATION>Socialist Party</ORGANIZATION> branch told <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION> .</S>

<S>Indonesian rupiah stable in quiet late trading .</S>
<S><LOCATION>JAKARTA</LOCATION> 1996-08-26</S>
<S>The Indonesian rupiah was stable against the dollar in quiet trading on Monday , dealers said .</S>
<S>They said volume was thin following a public holiday in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United Kingdom</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>" We didn't see anything from <LOCATION>Singapore</LOCATION> operators either .</S>
<S>It's a pretty quiet day , " one foreign bank dealer said .</S>
<S>Spot rupiah was quoted at 2,342.0 / 42.5 at 0915 GMT , unchanged from the opening level .</S>
<S>It was softer in the morning due to relatively ample rupiah liquidity but recovered later .</S>
<S>Tomorrow and today rupiah closed at 2,342.00 / 42.45 and 2,341.5 / 42.0 , respectively .</S>
<S>Another dealer said operators were reluctant to unload rupiah despite ample conditions due to the month-end factor .</S>
<S>" There are two factors which determine the market at present .</S>
<S>The liquidity at month-end and the next court hearing scheduled for Thursday , " the dealer said .</S>
<S><PERSON>Megawati Sukarnoputri</PERSON> , deposed leader of the <ORGANIZATION>Indonesian Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> ( <ORGANIZATION>PDI</ORGANIZATION> ) has sued the government for ousting her as <ORGANIZATION>PDI</ORGANIZATION> leader .</S>
<S>The central <LOCATION>Jakarta</LOCATION> court adjourned the case last Thursday for possible out-of-court settlement .</S>
<S>The hearing is due to resume on Thursday .</S>
<S><PERSON>Megawati</PERSON>'s lawyers said they were still discussing a possible out of court settlement but they was not optimistic an agreement could be reached .</S>
<S>The dealer said this issue remained a factor but its importance to the market seemed to diminish .</S>
<S>He said liquidity would be the main concern for the next few days .</S>
<S>Overnight swap was at 0.45 / 0.48 and tom / next at 0.50 / 0.55 .</S>
<S>One-month swap was at 18.0 / 18.5 , two at 34.0 / 35.0 , three at 52.75 / 53.50 and six at 106.5 / 107.0 points .</S>

<S><LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> direct cash hog prices Tuesday were seen steady following strong demand Monday that lifted prices as much as $ 1.50 per cwt in some areas , livestock dealers said .</S>
<S>The demand was sparked by Saturday's active slaughter , which left some packers short on supplies to get Monday operations started , they said .</S>
<S>Top prices in <LOCATION>Iowa</LOCATION> / southern <LOCATION>Minnesota</LOCATION> Tuesday were expected to range from mostly $ 59.50 to $ 60.00 , steady following a $ 0.50 - $ 1.50 jump Monday .</S>

<S><PERSON>Gore</PERSON> presents new image of lead attack dog .</S>
<S><PERSON>Michael Posner</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>CHICAGO</LOCATION> 1996-08-26</S>
<S>No more mild-mannered and meek <PERSON>Al Gore</PERSON> , the vice president and likely heir apparent to President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> , emerged on Monday as the new Democratic attack dog leading a front-line assault on <PERSON>Bob Dole</PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON>Newt Gingrich</PERSON> .</S>
<S>While <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> takes a train trip to the Democratic Convention that will renominate him on Wednesday for a second term , <PERSON>Gore</PERSON> is the bright star in the convention city now .</S>
<S>Crowds anxiously wait for his appearances , thrusting out hands for him to grip as they scream " 12 more years " -- a wishful hope to eight years of <PERSON>Gore</PERSON> after a <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> re-election .</S>
<S>Over a 15-hour span from Sunday evening to Monday morning , so many people jammed <PERSON>Gore</PERSON> events that the fire marshal stopped members of <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> , reporters and others from entering a pro-Israel rally and a meeting of the <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> delegation .</S>
<S>In his appearances , the often stiff and wooden <PERSON>Gore</PERSON> seemed transformed into a new energetic , gesturing " pol " as he ripped into Republican presidential nominee <PERSON>Dole</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gingrich</PERSON> , who has emerged as the favorite right-wing foil of Democrats .</S>
<S><PERSON>Gore</PERSON> told a roaring labor rally of about 1,000 union workers that <PERSON>Dole</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gingrich</PERSON> were the virtual personifaction of evil , without even mentioning that former Housing Secretary <PERSON>Jack Kemp</PERSON> is <PERSON>Dole</PERSON>'s running mate .</S>
<S>" With equal measures of ignorance and audacity this two-headed monster of <PERSON>Dole</PERSON> and <PERSON>Gingrich</PERSON> has been launching an all out assault on decades of progress of behalf of working men and women , " <PERSON>Gore</PERSON> said to whoops of " 12 more years . "</S>
<S>" They want to drive you out of politics and they can't , " he added . "</S>
<S>They want to silence your voices in elections . "</S>
<S>At a downtown hotel Monday , the 48-year-old <PERSON>Gore</PERSON> gave <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> delegates a taste again of the new <PERSON>Gore</PERSON> .</S>
<S>" I want you to ask this question .</S>
<S>What would <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> face if the same extremist coalition , the <ORGANIZATION>Gingrich / Dole Congress</ORGANIZATION> , also controlled the executive branch ? "</S>
<S><PERSON>Gore</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>Noting the next presidential term will probably see two or three <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> justice nominations , he warned , " Their extremist agenda would come out of the <ORGANIZATION>Gingrich Congress</ORGANIZATION> , into and through the <ORGANIZATION>Dole White House</ORGANIZATION> , down through the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> . "</S>
<S>He painted a scene of horrors he saw if Republicans controlled the <LOCATION>White House</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> they hold now . "</S>
<S>Our personal and religious liberties would be at risk .</S>
<S>Medicare would be at risk of withering on the vine .</S>
<S>Medicaid would be at risk of being taken away from poor children .</S>
<S>Education would be at risk .</S>
<S>The environment would be at risk from the polluters that control that coalition , " he said .</S>
<S>His new style mixed an assault on Republicans with what he sees as " productive opportunity , a vision for the future that lifts up working families , that builds <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> stronger , that builds <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> stronger .</S>
<S>With your help we can re-elect <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON> . "</S>
<S><PERSON>Dole</PERSON>'s tax cut plans were called " deja-voodoo economics .... It's a warmed-over plan that failed and drove our economy into a ditch .</S>
<S>We got burned once and we won't let that happen to our nation again . "</S>
<S><PERSON>Gore</PERSON> ridiculed <PERSON>Dole</PERSON>'s defense of the tobacco industry , praised <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> for " courage " in advancing regulations of it .</S>
<S>To the delegates of <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> , a leading dairy state , <PERSON>Gore</PERSON> had the right audience in poking fun at <PERSON>Dole</PERSON>'s comparison to addiction to tobacco to those who can't tolerate milk .</S>
<S>" Some people say milk is bad for you , " <PERSON>Gore</PERSON> said as <LOCATION>Wisconsin</LOCATION> delegates held aloft a plastic inflated cow .</S>
<S>He praised <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> for vetoing the Republican <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> ' attempt to repeal parts of the Clean Air Act , and criticized Republicans for " slashing money to combat drugs in schools . "</S>
<S>" The choice has never been starker , the stakes today have never been higher , " <PERSON>Gore</PERSON> said . "</S>

<S>Actor <PERSON>Reeve</PERSON> highlights Democrats ' first night .</S>
<S><LOCATION>CHICAGO</LOCATION> 1996-08-26</S>
<S>The highlights of the first day of the Democratic convention on Monday were expected to feature a mix of party leaders and people who have overcome adversity .</S>
<S>Among the latter were gun control advocate <PERSON>Sarah Brady</PERSON> and actor <PERSON>Christopher Reeve</PERSON> and the politicians included Rep .</S>
<S><PERSON>Richard Gephardt</PERSON> and Sen .</S>
<S><PERSON>Thomas Daschle</PERSON> .</S>
<S>Here are thumbnail profiles of the convention's key Monday speakers .</S>
<S><PERSON>Sarah Brady</PERSON> -- The nation's toughest gun control law is named after <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON>'s press secretary <PERSON>James Brady</PERSON> but it was his wife who was the major force behind its passage .</S>
<S>As head of <ORGANIZATION>Handgun Control Inc.</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Sarah Brady</PERSON> , 54 , campaigned nonstop for tough gun control in the years following the shooting of her husband and then President <PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> in 1981 .</S>
<S>Her reward was the passage in 1993 of the " Brady Bill " which requires a mandatory five-day waiting period for purchase of handguns and also mandates background checks for would-be gun purchasers .</S>
<S><PERSON>Reagan</PERSON> recovered fully from his wounds but <PERSON>Brady</PERSON> , who was close to death after being shot by <PERSON>John Hinckley Jr</PERSON> .</S>
<S>, suffered serious brain damage .</S>
<S><PERSON>Sarah</PERSON> was <PERSON>Brady</PERSON>'s second wife and they have a son , <PERSON>James Scott Brady Jr</PERSON> .</S>
<S>Before the assassination attempt , she had worked for Republican congressmen and for the <ORGANIZATION>Republican Party</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S><PERSON>Christopher Reeve</PERSON> -- <PERSON>Reeve</PERSON> was best known for playing the comic book hero <PERSON>Superman</PERSON> in four movies but his greatest heroics came in real life .</S>
<S><PERSON>Reeve</PERSON> , an accomplished rider who owned several horses , suffered multiple injuries including two shattered neck vertebrae when he was thrown from his horse at an equestrian event in <LOCATION>Culpepper</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> , on May 27 , 1995 .</S>
<S>Almost entirely paralyzed , <PERSON>Reeve</PERSON> underwent extensive surgery to fuse the vertebrae to the base of the skull and prevent any further damage to his spine .</S>
<S>That allowed him to be moved to a semi-upright position .</S>
<S>Over time he regained the power of speech , so much so that he was asked to address the opening night of the Democratic National Convention .</S>
<S><PERSON>Reeve</PERSON> , 43 , was classically trained as an actor but became the prototypical handsome leading man .</S>
<S>He performed in summer stock and soap operas before being plucked as an almost unknown to play the lead in " <PERSON>Superman</PERSON> " and three sequels .</S>
<S><PERSON>Richard Gephardt</PERSON> -- <PERSON>Gephardt</PERSON> , <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> Democratic leader , is a politician with a " <PERSON>Mr Clean</PERSON> " reputation who sought the presidency eight years ago and is widely believed to still have ambitions for the job .</S>
<S><PERSON>Gephardt</PERSON> , 55 , the son of a milkman from a working class district of <LOCATION>St. Louis</LOCATION> , is a consummate congressional insider , sufficiently skilled in compromise and the ways of the legislature to manage the often-unruly <ORGANIZATION>House</ORGANIZATION> Democrats .</S>
<S>A former lawyer , he was in the front line of President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON>'s battle with the Republican-led <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> over the budget but has opposed the president's decision to sign the Republican-written welfare reform bill .</S>
<S>He advocated tough action against foreign countries to cut <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> trade deficits but sometimes been out of step with the party's liberal wing .</S>
<S>He was an opponent of abortion until 1986 and voted for President <PERSON>Ronald Reagan</PERSON>'s big tax cut bill .</S>
<S><PERSON>Gephardt</PERSON> , a red-haired square-jawed man , is a less than fiery orator .</S>
<S>His 1988 bid for the Democratic nomination only took off after he recreated himself as a firebreathing reformer of the establishment , standing up for blue collar workers and farmers .</S>
<S><PERSON>Tom Daschle</PERSON> -- <PERSON>Daschle</PERSON> , 48 , was largely unknown outside <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> and his state of <LOCATION>South Dakota</LOCATION> when he surprisingly beat more prominent rivals to become <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> Democratic leader after the party lost its majority to the Republicans in 1994 .</S>
<S>A mild-mannered and youthful man who rose rapidly after entering the <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> in 1987 , he presented himself as a <LOCATION>Midwest</LOCATION> moderate , as a Democratic winner in a Republican state able to unite <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> factions .</S>
<S>Concern that he might be steamrollered by the vastly more experienced Republican leader <PERSON>Bob Dole</PERSON> was dispelled when he showed a tough edge , outmaneuvering <PERSON>Dole</PERSON> in a wrangle over scrapping a gas tax and raising the federal minimum wage .</S>
<S>In his early <ORGANIZATION>Senate</ORGANIZATION> years he was seen as a " prairie populist " , working on legislation protecting farmers ' prices and also on compensating veterans sickened by Agent Orange defoliant spraying in the Vietnam War .</S>
<S><PERSON>Daschle</PERSON> was a key player in President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON>'s failed attempt at sweeping healthcare changes but when he became minority leader he declared he would be no water-carrier for the <LOCATION>White House</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>He has made clear he opposed <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s signing of the Republican-initiated welfare reform bill .</S>
<S>He has spent his adult life in politics , coming to <ORGANIZATION>Congress</ORGANIZATION> as an aide in 1972 after three years in the <ORGANIZATION>Air Force</ORGANIZATION> and then being elected to the <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> himself in 1978 .</S>

<S><LOCATION>CLEVELAND</LOCATION> 1996-08-26</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Brush Wellman Inc</ORGANIZATION> said Monday that 10 of 24 lawsuits involving chronic beryllium disease have been dismissed since July 1 .</S>
<S>The leading <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> beryllium producer said in a conference call it has traditionally been pro-active regarding the workplace disease , a lung ailment which can affects a small percent of people whose immune systems are susceptible .</S>
<S>Of the 14 remaining suits , 10 were filed by employees of industrial <ORGANIZATION>Brush Wellman</ORGANIZATION> customers and <ORGANIZATION>Brush Wellman</ORGANIZATION> liability in such suits is typically covered by insurance , <PERSON>Timothy Reid</PERSON> , vice president of corporate communications , said on the call .</S>
<S>The company was responding to an article in Sunday's <ORGANIZATION>New York Times</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>He said the article largely reiterated information about the suits and the disease which had previously been made public via <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> filings and annual reports .</S>
<S>" <ORGANIZATION>Brush Wellman</ORGANIZATION> has been a leader in dealing with health and safety issues ( related to chronic Beryllium disease ) for nearly 50 years , " he said . "</S>
<S>We have a record of going beyond regulatory requirements ... and we consistently share the most current information available ... with customers and employees . "</S>
<S>The customer employee suits were filed in 1990-95 , he said .</S>
<S>A class action filed by a former <ORGANIZATION>Brush Wellman</ORGANIZATION> employee in April 1996 was dismissed in July , he said .</S>

<S>Dutch closing share market report .</S>
<S><LOCATION>AMSTERDAM</LOCATION> 1996-08-26</S>
<S>Dutch shares drifted to a lower close on Monday , dragged down by weakness in the domestic bond market and turnover depressed by the <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> bank holiday and lack of any significant <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> economic data .</S>
<S>The AEX index of leading shares closed 4.54 points easier at 556.19 , the day's low .</S>
<S>The Dutch market had been on the defensive all day but a softer start to <LOCATION>Wall Street</LOCATION> did little to boost sentiment in late trade , dealers said .</S>
<S>" It was always going to be a tough day with participation so low .</S>
<S>But the only thing really worrying the market was the bonds , and that dragged us lower , " one dealer said .</S>
<S>Stocks were down across the board , with <ORGANIZATION>Dutch PTT</ORGANIZATION> topping the volume list and closing down 1.90 guilders at 58.70 .</S>
<S>The post and telecoms firm posted an 8.5 percent rise in first half earnings on Friday , just below analysts ' expectations .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>IHC Caland</ORGANIZATION> reported first half results well under forecasts on Monday and the shares suffered as a result .</S>
<S>They were trading unchanged just before the release of figures but closed 2.40 guilders down at 80.70 after it reported net profits of 34.9 million guilders against 36.6 million last year and estimates ranging from 37.5 to 47.2 million .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>IHC</ORGANIZATION> also forecast post tax earnings rising 21 percent for the full year .</S>
<S>Banking group <ORGANIZATION>ING</ORGANIZATION> traded ex-dividend today and finished 0.60 guilders weaker at 52.90 as a result .</S>
<S>But <ORGANIZATION>Nutricia</ORGANIZATION> shrugged off its ex-div tag to soar a further 4.10 guilders to 214.40 continuing its explosive rally sparked by the 51 percent jump in first half net profits last week , which set the market alight on Friday , sending the shares up 18.40 at 210.00 by the close .</S>
<S>Engineering concern <ORGANIZATION>Stork</ORGANIZATION> started the day well as the shares attracted some follow-through interest to the announcement late on Friday that its <ORGANIZATION>Fokker Aviation</ORGANIZATION> unit had won a major order .</S>
<S>But the rally was short-lived and <ORGANIZATION>Stork</ORGANIZATION> ended just 0.20 up at 51.00 guilders .</S>

<S><PERSON>Tapie</PERSON> to quit French assembly seat as film opens .</S>
<S><LOCATION>PARIS</LOCATION> 1996-08-26</S>
<S>Former businessman and soccer boss <PERSON>Bernard Tapie</PERSON> said that he would give up his seat in the <ORGANIZATION>National Assembly</ORGANIZATION> by Wednesday , the day a film by <PERSON>Claude Lelouche</PERSON> in which he stars opens in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>" I will no longer be deputy by the time the film opens , " he said in a broadcast interview .</S>
<S>" Just about , " he told <ORGANIZATION>Europe 1</ORGANIZATION> radio when asked whether he had sent his letter of resignation to <ORGANIZATION>Assembly</ORGANIZATION> speaker <PERSON>Philippe Seguin</PERSON> .</S>
<S>A <PERSON>Seguin</PERSON> spokeswoman confirmed that no letter or call had yet been received .</S>
<S><PERSON>Tapie</PERSON> , 53 , was resigning just ahead of expected government action to eject him from the <ORGANIZATION>Assembly</ORGANIZATION> following a finding by the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> that he was bankrupt and thus ineligible for public office for a five-year period .</S>
<S><PERSON>Tapie</PERSON> , the target of a blizzard of legal actions over his now-destroyed business empire and the <ORGANIZATION>Marseille</ORGANIZATION> soccer team he once ran , has a starring role in <PERSON>Lelouche</PERSON>'s " Homme , femmes : mode d'emploi " ( Men , women : instructions for use ) .</S>
<S>He plays a power-hungry lawyer in the movie described as " a tender and cruel comedy " by <PERSON>Lelouche</PERSON> , who is making his 35th film .</S>
<S>" I have paid too dearly for mixing two careers , " <PERSON>Tapie</PERSON> said . "</S>
<S>In <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> , you cannot be a film artist and a national politician at the same time .</S>
<S>That is why I will no longer be deputy by the time the film opens . "</S>
<S>Justice Minister <PERSON>Jacques Toubon</PERSON> began last month the formal process of ejecting <PERSON>Tapie</PERSON> from the French parliament as well as stripping him of his seat in the European parliament .</S>
<S>The French procedure was expected to be completed before October 2 , when the <ORGANIZATION>National Assembly</ORGANIZATION> is to reconvene after a summer break , but the European procedure was expected to take longer .</S>
<S><PERSON>Tapie</PERSON>'s lawyer has said he intends to appeal to the <ORGANIZATION>European Court of Human Rights</ORGANIZATION> in an effort to prevent or delay the loss of his European seat .</S>
<S>But such an appeal , even if the court were to accept the case , which it is not obliged to do , would not suspend enforcement of the French judgement against him .</S>
<S><PERSON>Tapie</PERSON> faces a probable spell in prison after he loses his parliamentary immunity , since two appeal courts have confirmed jail sentences of eight and six months against him for tax fraud and rigging a soccer match .</S>
<S>He is appealing in both cases to the <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> .</S>

<S>" We expect reasonable growth in the second half .</S>
<S>Maybe it will be in single-digits , " <PERSON>Wijffels</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION> .</S>

<S>FOCUS - <ORGANIZATION>Eurobourses</ORGANIZATION> end mixed but <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> recovers .</S>
<S><PERSON>Leonard Santorelli</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>LONDON</LOCATION> 1996-08-27</S>
<S>European bourses closed mixed on Tuesday with <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> clawing back most of the day's losses despite an unsteady start on <ORGANIZATION>wall Street</ORGANIZATION> , hit by inflation worries .</S>
<S>The dollar weakened during the day with many dealers sidelined because of uncertainty over <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION>'s monetary direction ahead of the important Japanese <ORGANIZATION>Tankan</ORGANIZATION> economic survey out on Wednesday .</S>
<S>But it recovered at the close of trade .</S>
<S>Stocks in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> started the week badly after a three-day weekend , slipping 0.3 percent , but bargain-hunters later moved in and the FTSE index recovered most of the lost ground to end only just in negative ground .</S>
<S>Tuesday's patchy showing in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> followed a string of records last week , culminating in Friday's trading high of 3,911 , fuelled by a wave of European interest rate cuts .</S>
<S>The <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> bourse drew little help from the unsettled morning on <LOCATION>Wall Street</LOCATION> , which slipped in and out of positive ground after a stronger-than-expected August consumer confidence report refuelled inflation fears , pulling <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Treasuries</ORGANIZATION> back from their early peaks .</S>
<S>Shortly after the report appeared showing the confidence index rising to 109.4 in August from a revised 107.0 in July , <LOCATION>Wall Street</LOCATION> relinquished virtually all its morning gains .</S>
<S>" <ORGANIZATION>Treasuries</ORGANIZATION> remain very sensitive to any indication of a strong economy and we're still in that summer doldrum period of light trading , " said <PERSON>Alan Ackerman</PERSON> , market strategist at <ORGANIZATION>Fahnestock & Co</ORGANIZATION> . "</S>
<S>Consequently , stocks and bonds are both subject to rapid swings . "</S>
<S><LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> was the one bright spot in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>Floor trading ended up 0.25 percent and the computerised IBIS index climbed nearly 0.4 percent , given a push by the performance of chemical shares . "</S>
<S>The market is trading 100 percent on fundamentals at the moment as interest rate fantasy disappears -- it's all company news , " said one trader .</S>
<S>French shares ended slightly down amid growing unease about a difficult autumn for the government which also weighed on the franc , dealers said .</S>
<S>Bond prices were weaker and the franc was quoted at 3.4210 per mark for the first time since August 13 as worries about the government's autumn budget and a weak <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> currency lifted the mark and squeezed French investments .</S>
<S>The dollar , which dropped sharply on Monday because of jitters over the Japanese <ORGANIZATION>Tankan</ORGANIZATION> survey , weakened further in quiet trading but regained losses to end the day close to Monday's levels .</S>
<S>" Besides the <ORGANIZATION>Tankan</ORGANIZATION> , there's nothing really until the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> jobs numbers next week , " said a <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> bank corporate dealer . "</S>
<S>There is still the summer malaise hanging over the market . "</S>
<S>Foreign exchange markets regard the <ORGANIZATION>Tankan</ORGANIZATION> report as an important indication of the country's future monetary policy direction .</S>
<S>If it points to weakness in the economy , the report will help the dollar regain some lost ground as speculation of a near-term rise in Japanese interest rates will evaporate .</S>
<S>The Japanese discount rate is currently at a record low of 0.5 percent .</S>
<S>The dollar was also pressured by the mark's strength against European currencies amid renewed concerns over <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION>'s economic and monetary union ( EMU ) timetable .</S>
<S>CURRENCIES</S>
<S>The dollar was at 1.4788 marks and 107.74 yen at the close of European trading compared with 1.4789 marks and 107.55 yen on Monday .</S>
<S>STOCK MARKETS</S>
<S>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares ended 1.8 points lower at 3,905.7 .</S>
<S>In <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> , the CAC-40 share index finished down 2.43 at 2,017.99 .</S>
<S>The 30-share DAX index in <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> closed up 6.48 at 2,558.84 .</S>
<S>PRECIOUS METALS</S>
<S>Gold closed at $ 388.55 an ounce , compared with Monday's close of $ 388.75 on international markets .</S>

<S>More hostages freed from hijacked Sudanese plane .</S>
<S><LOCATION>STANSTED</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> 1996-08-27</S>
<S>Armed hijackers believed to be Iraqis released between 60 and 70 people on Tuesday from a <ORGANIZATION>Sudan Airways</ORGANIZATION> plane carrying 199 passengers and crew that landed in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> after being diverted on a flight from <LOCATION>Khartoum</LOCATION> to <LOCATION>Amman</LOCATION> , authorities said .</S>
<S>A spokesman for <LOCATION>Stansted</LOCATION> airport said that the unidentified hijackers were demanding to see a British-based member of the <ORGANIZATION>Iraqi Community Association</ORGANIZATION> , called Mr <PERSON>Sadiki</PERSON> , and that police were trying to trace him .</S>
<S>Police spokeswoman <PERSON>Kim White</PERSON> said police had already contacted <PERSON>Sadiki</PERSON> and were trying to arrange to bring him to <LOCATION>Stansted</LOCATION> , 30 miles ( 48 km ) north-east of <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> , to talk to the hijackers .</S>
<S>The airport spokesman said the six hijackers , who police said were armed with grenades and possibly other explosives , were believed to be Iraqi nationals .</S>
<S>The hijackers started to release people for the Airbus plane in batches of 10 , starting with women and children , in what police described as a " controlled release " .</S>
<S>Police said most of the passengers were Sudanese but that there were also an unknown number of Iraqis , Jordanians , Palestinians , Syrians and Saudis .</S>
<S>Later they said the number of passengers released from the plane had reached 80 .</S>

<S>FEATURE - " Eco terrorists " target <LOCATION>UK</LOCATION> builders .</S>
<S><PERSON>Edna Fernandes</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>LONDON</LOCATION> 1996-08-27</S>
<S>Ecological warfare has broken out across the British construction industry , striking some of the biggest corporates as activists give up peaceful protests and seek to hit builders where it hurts -- their profit margins .</S>
<S>Described by one British company as " eco-terrorism " , it is seen as the new business risk of the 1990s .</S>
<S>Famous names like <ORGANIZATION>Tarmac Plc</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Costain Group Plc</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>ARC</ORGANIZATION> , a unit of conglomerate <ORGANIZATION>Hanson Plc</ORGANIZATION> , have all been targeted .</S>
<S>Activist groups are no longer seen by British firms as a harmless , badly organised ragbag of students and hippies .</S>
<S>" You only have to see them in action at protests , " said <PERSON>David Harding</PERSON> , spokesman at <ORGANIZATION>ARC</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Hanson</ORGANIZATION>'s aggregates company . "</S>
<S>They walk around with mobile phones and camera equipment , they communicate and gather support for demos via the Internet -- we're talking about a highly sophisticated organisation . "</S>
<S>One road protestor under the codename <PERSON>Steady Eddie</PERSON> told construction journal " <ORGANIZATION>Building</ORGANIZATION> " earlier this year , " If it comes down to full-scale economic warfare , we will aim to drive them out of business . "</S>
<S>As well as financial threats , companies also emphasise the " terror " tactics used .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Costain</ORGANIZATION>'s contract to build the controversial <LOCATION>Newbury</LOCATION> bypass , which runs through a conservation area , has led to violent protests delaying building , bomb threats , staff intimidation and picketing of chief executive <PERSON>Alan Lovell</PERSON>'s home .</S>
<S>A <ORGANIZATION>Costain</ORGANIZATION> spokesman told <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION> : " We've had all sorts of protests at the head office and the chief executive's house .</S>
<S>But it's when it gets to the ( employee ) families -- that it goes across the line . "</S>
<S>Tactics used by some underground groups including the cryptic <ORGANIZATION>Berkshire Wood Elves</ORGANIZATION> , which distribute leaflets with instructions on home-made explosives , are now the subject of a police investigation .</S>
<S>Other larger activist groups include <ORGANIZATION>Earth First</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>The Land is Ours</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>Alarm UK</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Road Alert</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>The groups have targeted specific projects like the <LOCATION>Newbury</LOCATION> bypass and the <LOCATION>M3</LOCATION> motorway through <LOCATION>Twyford Down</LOCATION> in the southern county of <LOCATION>Hampshire</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>But they are also campaigning on broader issue such as stopping the government road building programme and out-of-town superstores which they say create more traffic , pollution and damage local communities .</S>
<S>The government has slashed its road-building spending .</S>
<S>Although protests may have contributed to the decision it has been seen primarily as economic rather than ecological .</S>
<S><PERSON>Graham Watts</PERSON> , chief executive of the <ORGANIZATION>Construction Industry Council</ORGANIZATION> , said : " I don't think many firms involved in tendering for sensitive projects realise the impact environmental activity has on the cost of running a project .</S>
<S>" But they are more alert than they were 3-4 years ago .</S>
<S>There's no doubt it's a big issue now . "</S>
<S>He says the damage comes in two forms : " Tangible -- in the form of extra costs , additional security , threats to staff and the more intangible damage caused by negative publicity . "</S>
<S><PERSON>Watts</PERSON> said the cost of protesting can be heavy once the company is locked into a contract .</S>
<S>" I do often hear on the industry circuit of tales where the company tenders at low margins and the demonstrations which follow means they are running the project at a loss . "</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>ARC</ORGANIZATION> says it's not just contractors in the front line but also suppliers like itself .</S>
<S>Its own quarries came under attack after it emerged that it may be a supplier for the <LOCATION>Newbury</LOCATION> bypass .</S>
<S>" It was called the " First Battle of the Newbury bypass ' , " said <ORGANIZATION>ARC</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Harding</PERSON> .</S>
<S>" We had 300 <ORGANIZATION>Earth First</ORGANIZATION> protestors invade and occupy our site .</S>
<S>Hundreds of thousands of pounds ( dollars ) of damage was done in one day .</S>
<S>Plus there was the knock-on cost of lost production and extra security in future . "</S>
<S><PERSON>Simon Brown</PERSON> , analyst at investement bank <ORGANIZATION>UBS</ORGANIZATION> , said this new phenomenon has led to a change in the way the industry evaluates project risk .</S>
<S>" When talking to <ORGANIZATION>Tarmac</ORGANIZATION> about the <LOCATION>M3</LOCATION> link ( through <LOCATION>Twyford Down</LOCATION> ) they made it fairly clear that their risk assessment methods have been changed and now involve a very clear environmental risk analysis . "</S>
<S><PERSON>Harding</PERSON> says others have done the same . "</S>
<S>As a result of eco-terrorism we are looking at controversial jobs more closely to see if the profit margins are wide enough to cover things like extra security . "</S>
<S>For an industry already suffering from razor-thin margins , overcapacity and stagnant demand , eco-terrorism is the latest bizarre twist in the construction sector's tale of woe .</S>

<S>London Carnival ends in high spirits .</S>

<S><LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s annual Notting Hill Carnival , the largest in <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> and second in the world only to <LOCATION>Rio</LOCATION> , ended peacefully on Monday with an estimated 800,000 revellers singing and dancing the day away in high spirits .</S>
<S>Police said they made 30 arrests and there were two stabbings .</S>
<S>But there was no repeat of the ugly scenes that used to scar the street festival , and police praised the crowds over the two days of festivities as good-natured .</S>
<S>Around 400 police were wounded in riots in 1976 when the carnival , now in its 31st year , acquired its darker reputation from which it is now only slowly recovering .</S>
<S>Shopkeepers still board up their windows and many residents leave town for the weekend , but for four or five years there has been no disorder and relatively little crime .</S>

<S>The Spaniard has not played for nearly a year because of rheumatoid arthritis in both his feet , and organisers of a pairs event to be staged in <LOCATION>Bordeaux</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> from October 17 to 20 have been asked to provide him with a buggy .</S>
<S>" If the ( Tour's tournament ) committee decides to change the rule I would not be against it , " said <PERSON>Ballesteros</PERSON> , <PERSON>Olazabal</PERSON>'s compatriot and Ryder Cup captain .</S>

<S>The use of carts is generally prohibited in the professional game , and if <PERSON>Olazabal</PERSON> is allowed to use one in <LOCATION>Bordeaux</LOCATION> , he might then request one for the qualifying tournaments for next year's Ryder Cup .</S>

<S>TENNIS - <PERSON>CHANG</PERSON> , <LOCATION>WASHINGTON</LOCATION> ADVANCE , TWO WOMEN's SEEDS FALL .</S>
<S><PERSON>Larry Fine</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>NEW YORK</LOCATION> 1996-08-26</S>
<S><PERSON>Michael Chang</PERSON> is playing in his 10th U.S. Open and enjoying his highest seeding ever , but the 24-year-old American had to overcome a case of the jitters Monday before winning his first-round match on opening day .</S>
<S><PERSON>Chang</PERSON> , seeded second behind defending champion <PERSON>Pete Sampras</PERSON> , took two hours 40 minutes to defeat 186th-ranked <PERSON>Jaime Oncins</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> 3-6 6-1 6-0 7-6 , 8-6 in the tiebreaker .</S>
<S>" I was pretty tight the whole match , " conceded <PERSON>Chang</PERSON> , one of the hottest players on tour this summer with a 16-2 record on hardcourts that included two titles and a runner-up finish .</S>
<S>" Everyone has moments when they get tight .</S>
<S>Hopefully , this will have been my nerves for the whole tournament . "</S>
<S>Joining <PERSON>Chang</PERSON> into the second round was Wimbledon runner-up <PERSON>MaliVai Washington</PERSON> , the 11th seed , who also needed four sets to get past talented Moroccan <PERSON>Karim Alami</PERSON> 6-4 2-6 7-6 ( 7-5 ) 6-1 .</S>
<S><PERSON>Washington</PERSON>'s win was not comfortable , either .</S>
<S>The 27-year-old American hurried off the <LOCATION>Stadium Court</LOCATION> for treatment of an upset stomach after his two and a half hour struggle against <PERSON>Alami</PERSON> .</S>
<S>" Towards the end of my match my stomach felt like week-old sushi , " said <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> . "</S>
<S>Maybe it was a combination of the heat and something I ate . "</S>
<S><PERSON>Chang</PERSON> and <PERSON>Washington</PERSON> were the only men's seeds in action on a day that saw two seeded women's players fall .</S>
<S>Australian Open runner-up <PERSON>Anke Huber</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> , the sixth seed , was undone by an unlucky draw that put her against 17th ranked South African <PERSON>Amanda Coetzer</PERSON> in her opening match .</S>
<S><PERSON>Coetzer</PERSON> claimed revenge for the semifinal defeat she suffered to <PERSON>Huber</PERSON> in <LOCATION>Melbourne</LOCATION> by taking a 6-1 2-6 6-2 victory .</S>
<S>Last year's Wimbledon junior champion , <PERSON>Aleksandra Olsza</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> , removed another seed from the draw by eliminating number 12 <PERSON>Magdalena Maleeva</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Bulgaria</LOCATION> 6-4 6-2 .</S>
<S>Other men's winners included a pair of former Grand Slam tournament champions whose victories set up a showdown in the second round .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Michael Stich</PERSON> , the 1991 Wimbledon champion , and two-time French Open winner <PERSON>Sergi Bruguera</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Spain</LOCATION> will face each other next after beating German <PERSON>Tommy Haas</PERSON> 6-3 1-6 6-1 7-5 , and Belgian <PERSON>Kris Goossens</PERSON> 6-2 6-0 7-6 ( 7-1 ) , respectively .</S>
<S><PERSON>Alex O'Brien</PERSON> , who scored his first professional title eight days ago in <LOCATION>New Haven</LOCATION> , advanced to the second round with a 6-4 1-6 6-4 6-3 win over <LOCATION>Ecuador</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Nicolas Lapentti</PERSON> .</S>
<S>Wimbledon bad boy <PERSON>Jeff Tarango</PERSON> caught a break Monday when he advanced after the retirement of German <PERSON>Alex Radulescu</PERSON> due to heat exhaustion .</S>
<S><PERSON>Tarango</PERSON> was leading 6-7 ( 5-7 ) 6-4 6-1 3-1 .</S>
<S><PERSON>Chang</PERSON> blamed breezy conditions for some of the erratic play in his match with <PERSON>Oncins</PERSON> , who had beaten him in the round of 32 at the 1992 <LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION> Olympics .</S>
<S><PERSON>Chang</PERSON> committed an untidy 53 unforced errors , though he made seven fewer than the Brazilian , who also walloped a woeful 24 double faults .</S>
<S>The most deflating double fault came when <PERSON>Oncins</PERSON> was serving to force a fifth set , leading 6-4 in the tiebreaker .</S>
<S>The set point came after confusion at the net on the point previous , which was awarded to <PERSON>Oncins</PERSON> after the two exchanged shots at close quarters at the net .</S>
<S>First <PERSON>Chang</PERSON> approached the umpire , then <PERSON>Oncins</PERSON> , then <PERSON>Chang</PERSON> again before play finally resumed .</S>
<S>" Those little seconds were like an hour to me , " said <PERSON>Oncins</PERSON> , who promptly fired two serves barely contained by the baseline as he frittered away his best chance .</S>
<S><PERSON>Chang</PERSON> ran off the next three points to close out the match but for <PERSON>Oncins</PERSON> , the contest was a personal victory .</S>
<S>The 26-year-old Brazilian had risen into the top 30 in 1992 .</S>
<S>The next year a close friend was struck by a stray bullet while riding home in a car from a soccer game in <LOCATION>Sao Paulo</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>He died slumped against <PERSON>Oncins</PERSON> , who subsequently lost interest in tennis .</S>
<S>" Two months ago I started talking about quitting , " said <PERSON>Oncins</PERSON> , who decided to give it one last try and made it through the Open qualifying tournament last weekend .</S>
<S>" I believe in my game again , " he said .</S>
<S>At the end of the day , a spate of withdrawals from the tournament were announced .</S>
<S>Eighth seed <PERSON>Jim Courier</PERSON> withdrew because of a bruised right knee , and 1988 Open champion <PERSON>Mats Wilander</PERSON> bowed out due to a groin pull , organisers said .</S>

<S>SOCCER - <ORGANIZATION>MARSEILLE</ORGANIZATION> HOLD <ORGANIZATION>AUXERRE</ORGANIZATION> TO GOALLESS DRAW .</S>
<S><LOCATION>PARIS</LOCATION> 1996-08-27</S>
<S>Former European champions <ORGANIZATION>Marseille</ORGANIZATION> held French champions <ORGANIZATION>Auxerre</ORGANIZATION> to a goalless draw in a lacklustre league match on Tuesday .</S>
<S>The bill looked promising but both sides , struggling to find their form early in the season , were disappointing .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Auxerre</ORGANIZATION> , who start their European Cup campaign next week against <ORGANIZATION>Ajax Amsterdam</ORGANIZATION> , dominated the match but were unable to score .</S>
<S>Unbeaten in four matches , they still trail leaders <ORGANIZATION>Lens</ORGANIZATION> by one point .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Lens</ORGANIZATION> , who have won all their three league matches so far , host <ORGANIZATION>Montpellier</ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday night .</S>
<S>Despite another dismal performance , especially in defence , <ORGANIZATION>Marseille</ORGANIZATION> restored some pride by keeping the reigning champions at bay after losing 2-1 at home to <ORGANIZATION>Metz</ORGANIZATION> last Saturday .</S>
<S>After two seasons in the second division and after taking on half a dozen new recruits this season , some of whom do not speak a word of French , <ORGANIZATION>Marseille</ORGANIZATION> are not playing with any fluidity .</S>
<S>But German international goalkeeper <PERSON>Andreas Koepke</PERSON> again proved a sound investment when under pressure from the <ORGANIZATION>Auxerre</ORGANIZATION> strikers , saving his team with a number of fine parries .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Marseille</ORGANIZATION> now lie seventh in the league on five points .</S>

<S><PERSON>Moura</PERSON> , who appeared to have elbowed <PERSON>Cyprien</PERSON> in the final minutes of the 3-0 win by <ORGANIZATION>Neuchatel</ORGANIZATION> , was suspended for seven matches and fined 1,000 francs ( $ 840 ) by the Swiss league disciplinary committee .</S>
<S>Club president <PERSON>Gilbert Facchinetti</PERSON> said he was astonished the committee had arrived at its decision so quickly and vowed the club would appeal .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Neuchatel</ORGANIZATION> coach <PERSON>Gilbert Gress</PERSON> described the incident as " shocking " , but said <PERSON>Moura</PERSON> was also to blame .</S>

<S><ORGANIZATION>COFINEC</ORGANIZATION> SLIPS ON <LOCATION>BUDAPEST</LOCATION> BOURSE BUT FUTURE STRONG .</S>
<S><PERSON>Emese Bartha</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>BUDAPEST</LOCATION> 1996-08-27</S>
<S>Expectations that <ORGANIZATION>Cofinec S.A.</ORGANIZATION> , the Hungarian bourse's first foreign listing , will report a disappointing first half have depressed the stock below its issue price , but analysts expect a rebound in the long term .</S>
<S>" The first half of the year is unlikely to be as strong as expected so the company will probably be unable to reach its annual plan in 1996 , " said <PERSON>Gabor Sitanyi</PERSON> , a London-based analyst for <ORGANIZATION>ING Barings</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>The French-registered packaging materials company , which floated its shares in <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> in July , for most of the past two weeks hovered below the 6,425 forints / Global Depositary Receipts price of its initial offering , which was oversubscribed .</S>
<S>The company , which asked for a two-week delay from the usual August 15 deadline for reporting first-half results , closed on Tuesday at 5,800 forints , down 300 .</S>
<S>" <ORGANIZATION>Cofinec</ORGANIZATION>'s first-half figures will be ...</S>
<S>between one-third of two-fifths of its annual plan , " said <PERSON>Tamas Erdei</PERSON> , a Budapest-based analyst for <ORGANIZATION>ABN-AMRO Hoare Govett</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>Analysts blame , at least partly , <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION>'s macroeconomic environment for the weaker figures for <ORGANIZATION>Cofinec</ORGANIZATION> which , operating in <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Czech Republic</LOCATION> , now generates about 55 to 60 percent of its annual sales from <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION>'s Gross Domestic Product fell one percentage point in the first quarter while real wages plunged 7.2 percentage points in the first half of 1996 .</S>
<S>Both will have their impact on <ORGANIZATION>Cofinec</ORGANIZATION>'s figures , the analysts said .</S>
<S>Despite the current difficulties , however , analysts were convinced that <ORGANIZATION>Cofinec</ORGANIZATION>'s outlook was strong .</S>
<S>" The eastern European market offers good chances , " said <PERSON>Erdei</PERSON> . "</S>
<S>Just like many other companies on the bourse , <ORGANIZATION>Cofinec</ORGANIZATION> has big growth opportunities . "</S>
<S>" At the same time , it's an advantage for <ORGANIZATION>Cofinec</ORGANIZATION> that it has a foreign management which perhaps understands the market better , " <PERSON>Erdei</PERSON> added .</S>
<S>" <ORGANIZATION>Cofinec</ORGANIZATION> is a very good story in the long-term as the per capita packaging consumption is still so low in east <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> that a very strong increase can be expected ( long-term ) , " <PERSON>Sitanyi</PERSON> said , saying that several recent moves by <ORGANIZATION>Cofinec</ORGANIZATION> boosted its position .</S>
<S>Among them , he noted that <ORGANIZATION>Cofinec</ORGANIZATION> had acquired the outstanding stake in its Czech folding company <ORGANIZATION>Krpaco a.s.</ORGANIZATION> , increasing its ownership to 100 percent , so in the second half the whole of <ORGANIZATION>Krpaco</ORGANIZATION>'s figures will be consolidated .</S>
<S>The company also repaid some $ 21 million of debt , well above the originally planned $ 8 million to $ 9 million .</S>
<S>In addition , its Polish operation began with some six weeks of delay due to cold winter weather and the test run was also longer than planned .</S>

<S>Sudanese rebels say missionaries should be freed .</S>
<S><PERSON>Peter Smerdon</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>NAIROBI</LOCATION> 1996-08-27</S>
<S>The main rebel group in south <LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION> said on Tuesday it was trying to arrange the release of six Roman Catholic missionaries , including three Australian nuns , held for nearly two weeks .</S>
<S><PERSON>George Garang</PERSON> , <LOCATION>Nairobi</LOCATION> spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Sudan People's Liberation Army</ORGANIZATION> ( <ORGANIZATION>SPLA</ORGANIZATION> ) , said it was urgently trying to contact <ORGANIZATION>SPLA</ORGANIZATION> commander <PERSON>Nuour Marial</PERSON> at <LOCATION>Mapourdit</LOCATION> in the south to free the six .</S>
<S>" The movement is making arrangements for them to be set free .</S>
<S>This is a decision of the leadership , " <PERSON>Garang</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>" Commander <PERSON>Nuour Marial</PERSON> is a soldier so he must accept the leadership's decision .</S>
<S>But communications at this time of year are very difficult because of rains and a lack of power , " he added .</S>
<S>The <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Information Office</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Nairobi</LOCATION> said on Monday that four of the six had been charged by the <ORGANIZATION>SPLA</ORGANIZATION> with spying , spreading Islam and hindering recruitment into the rebel group .</S>
<S>" These charges are the interpretation of the church , " <PERSON>Garang</PERSON> said on Tuesday . "</S>
<S>We have no idea why they are being held .</S>
<S>We are still trying to establish contact with the local commander . "</S>
<S>Asked whether this meant the commander was out of control , <PERSON>Garang</PERSON> said the rebel movement was working on the problem .</S>
<S>He said he believed all six were being held in the mission compound at <LOCATION>Mapourdit</LOCATION> and were reported to be in good health .</S>
<S>The <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Information office</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Nairobi</LOCATION> said on Monday that Australian Sisters <PERSON>Moira Lynch</PERSON> , 73 , and <PERSON>Mary Batchelor</PERSON> , 68 , American Father <PERSON>Michael Barton</PERSON> , 48 , and Sudanese Father <PERSON>Raphael Riel</PERSON> , 48 , were held in a prison in south <LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION>SPLA</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>It said Australian Sister <PERSON>Maureen Carey</PERSON> , 52 , and Italian Brother <PERSON>Raniero Iacomella</PERSON> , 28 , were held inside the compound .</S>
<S>The church in <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> said on Monday <PERSON>Lynch</PERSON> , <PERSON>Batchelor</PERSON> , <PERSON>Barton</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Riel</LOCATION> were held in a prison until the weekend , when they were moved to join the other captives at the compound .</S>
<S>The <ORGANIZATION>Catholic Information Office</ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION>SPLA</ORGANIZATION> in the Kenyan capital had attributed the detentions of the six to a local commander and had promised they would be freed by August 23 .</S>
<S>But the church learned in a recent meeting with the local commander that no instructions to release the prisoners were received and they would be held until investigations were completed .</S>
<S>It said last Friday they were visited by Monsignor <PERSON>Caesar Mazzolari</PERSON> , apostolic administrator of the diocese of <LOCATION>Rumbek</LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION> , and an <ORGANIZATION>SPLA</ORGANIZATION> administrator and appeared in good condition .</S>
<S>" On August 17 the mission was surrounded ( by the <ORGANIZATION>SPLA</ORGANIZATION> ) and sealed off .</S>
<S>The evening of the same day the missionaries were put in prison or isolation .</S>
<S>Later the mission was looted , " it added .</S>
<S>An Australian foreign ministry official said the charges against them were " fairly bizarre " and a matter for concern .</S>
<S>He said Australian diplomats in <LOCATION>Nairobi</LOCATION> were working with the Roman Catholic church in southern <LOCATION>Sudan</LOCATION> and with <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> and Italian diplomats in the region to help free the missionaries .</S>
<S>The <ORGANIZATION>SPLA</ORGANIZATION> has fought <LOCATION>Khartoum</LOCATION>'s government forces in the south since 1983 for greater autonomy or independence of the mainly Christian and animist region from the Moslem , <LOCATION>Arabised north</LOCATION> .</S>

<S><ORGANIZATION>OSCE</ORGANIZATION> postpones Bosnian municipal elections .</S>
<S><LOCATION>SARAJEVO</LOCATION> 1996-08-27</S>
<S>The <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> diplomat in charge of elections in <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION> announced on Tuesday that voting for municipal assemblies would be postponed because of irregularities by the Serbs in registering voters .</S>
<S>Ambassador <PERSON>Robert Frowick</PERSON> , representing the <ORGANIZATION>Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe</ORGANIZATION> ( <ORGANIZATION>OSCE</ORGANIZATION> ) , told reporters that municipal polls due on September 14 with other Bosnian elections would be put off .</S>
<S>" I have made a chairman's decision that it is not feasible to hold municipal elections on September 14 , " said <PERSON>Frowick</PERSON> .</S>
<S>He said no exact date had been set but it was possible the local elections would take place in the spring of 1997 .</S>
<S>According to <ORGANIZATION>OSCE</ORGANIZATION> officials , Serb authorities have pressed their refugees to register to vote in towns now under Serb control , but which used to have Moslem majorities .</S>
<S>Human rights workers say authorities in <LOCATION>Serbia</LOCATION> and Bosnian Serb territory have conducted a well-organised campaign to coerce refugees into registering only on Serb territory and failed to inform them of their rights under the <LOCATION>Dayton</LOCATION> peace agreement .</S>
<S>Diplomats say the effect of the electoral engineering would be to establish political control over districts they conquered and ethnically cleansed in war .</S>
<S>The response of the Bosnian Serbs to the <ORGANIZATION>OSCE</ORGANIZATION>'s announcement was not immediately clear .</S>
<S>But Bosnian Serb leaders have hinted they would boycott the poll if the municipal elections were postponed , or go ahead with their own .</S>
<S>The Bosnian Serb cabinet , in a letter to the <ORGANIZATION>OSCE</ORGANIZATION> , said on Monday that any delay of local elections would be " a direct and flagrant violation fo the <LOCATION>Dayton</LOCATION> agreement " .</S>
<S>The Serbs , who administer half of <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION> in a Serb republic , said they had met all conditions for holding the September elections .</S>
<S>Diplomats fear that the crisis could cast doubt over the entire election process , which already appears set to confirm <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION>'s ethnic partition rather than its reintegration as the <LOCATION>Dayton</LOCATION> peace agreement had planned .</S>

<S>New talks in <LOCATION>Chechnya</LOCATION> as <PERSON>Lebed</PERSON> waits for <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> .</S>
<S><PERSON>Dmitry Kuznets</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>NOVYE ATAGI</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> 1996-08-27</S>
<S>Russian and rebel military commanders finally met in <LOCATION>Chechnya</LOCATION> on Tuesday for delayed talks aimed at finalising a ceasefire arranged last week by President <PERSON>Boris Yeltsin</PERSON>'s envoy <PERSON>Alexander Lebed</PERSON> .</S>
<S>The Russian army commander in the region , General <PERSON>Vyacheslav Tikhomirov</PERSON> , arrived at the rebel-held village of <LOCATION>Novye Atagi</LOCATION> , some 20 km ( 12 miles ) south of the Chechen capital <LOCATION>Grozny</LOCATION> for discussions with rebel chief-of-staff <PERSON>Aslan Maskhadov</PERSON> .</S>
<S>But <PERSON>Lebed</PERSON> himself , the <LOCATION>Kremlin</LOCATION> security chief , is still waiting back in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> to meet <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> over his plans for a lasting political settlement in <LOCATION>Chechnya</LOCATION> .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Itar-Tass</ORGANIZATION> news agency quoted the <LOCATION>Kremlin</LOCATION> press service as saying <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> , who left for a state holiday home near <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> on Monday , would hold no working meetings on Tuesday .</S>
<S><PERSON>Lebed</PERSON> interrupted talks with <LOCATION>Chechnya</LOCATION>'s separatists on a political deal on Sunday , saying he had to consult with <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> .</S>
<S>After a meeting failed to materialise on Monday , <PERSON>Lebed</PERSON>'s spokesman said he might meet the president on Tuesday .</S>
<S>But <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s spokesman rebuffed the suggestion , saying the president had left <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> for a holiday near the capital .</S>
<S>The Russians postponed the talks after a Chechen band disarmed a column of <ORGANIZATION>interior ministry</ORGANIZATION> troops on Sunday .</S>
<S>The Chechens said a renegade group seized the weapons and said on Monday they had all been returned .</S>
<S>The Russian command insisted that not all the weapons were the same as those taken .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Tass</ORGANIZATION> said the weapons and the practical implementation of the ceasefire signed by <PERSON>Lebed</PERSON> and <PERSON>Maskhadov</PERSON> last Thursday would be on the agenda of today's talks .</S>
<S>Neither spoke to reporters before the meeting , which started around 10.45 a.m. ( 0645 GMT ) .</S>
<S>Also in <LOCATION>Novye Atagi</LOCATION> on Tuesday morning , was <PERSON>Tim Guldimann</PERSON> , the Swiss diplomat who heads the <LOCATION>Chechnya</LOCATION> mission of the <ORGANIZATION>Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe</ORGANIZATION> ( <ORGANIZATION>OSCE</ORGANIZATION> ) .</S>
<S><PERSON>Guldimann</PERSON> , who helped broker an earlier truce in May , was not taking part in the Tikhomirov-Maskhadov talks .</S>
<S><PERSON>Lebed</PERSON>'s peace mission this month has stopped some of the worst fighting of the 20-month-old conflict .</S>
<S>However , tension on the ground indicates that it could falter if the momentum for a settlement is not maintained .</S>
<S>Three Russian servicemen were wounded in a total of six shooting incidents overnight , <ORGANIZATION>Itar-Tass</ORGANIZATION> news agency quoted the Russian military as saying on Tuesday morning .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>RIA</ORGANIZATION> news agency quoted an army source accusing rebel fighters of failing to turn up for joint Russian-Chechen police patrols in some districts of the capital <LOCATION>Grozny</LOCATION> on Tuesday .</S>
<S>But the separatist command told <ORGANIZATION>Interfax</ORGANIZATION> news agency the patrols , part of the truce brokered by <PERSON>Lebed</PERSON> last week , would begin on Tuesday after delays for " technical reasons " .</S>
<S><PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON>'s spokesman said he might meet officials during his break , but indicated <PERSON>Lebed</PERSON> was low on the list by saying <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> would need time to study the proposals before talking to him .</S>
<S>Russian news agencies also quoted the <LOCATION>Kremlin</LOCATION> spokesman as saying that <PERSON>Lebed</PERSON>'s representatives had not sought a meeting , hinting at an attempt by the president to put his popular and outspoken protege in his place with a lesson on protocol .</S>
<S><PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> , 65 , has kept a low profile since he was reelected in July , prompting new speculation that the two heart attacks he suffered last year and a rumoured drinking problem could be taking their toll , weakening his grip on affairs of state .</S>
<S>Aides have dismissed such speculation , insisting that he simply needs a rest after his energetic election campaign .</S>
<S>Some analysts say the <LOCATION>Kremlin</LOCATION> leader , whose order sending troops and tanks into <LOCATION>Chechnya</LOCATION> in 1994 started <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>'s ill-fated military campaign , could merely be reluctant to put his name to a peace process which might fall apart .</S>
<S>But <PERSON>Lebed</PERSON> , who has no real power without his boss and has hinted at dark forces in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> working against him , appears to think a deal will not stick without strong backing from <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> .</S>
<S>His proposals have not been spelled out but are expected to involve a compromise between the separatists ' demand for independence and <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>'s insistence that <LOCATION>Chechnya</LOCATION> remain part of the <LOCATION>Russian Federation</LOCATION> .</S>

<S>Nationalists want <PERSON>Iliescu</PERSON> ousted for <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> pact .</S>
<S><LOCATION>BUCHAREST</LOCATION> 1996-08-27</S>
<S>Junior Nationalist members of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s ruling coalition called on Tuesday for the impeachment of President <PERSON>Ion Iliescu</PERSON> for backing a friendship treaty with neighbouring <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> .</S>
<S><PERSON>Iliescu</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Party of Social Democracy</ORGANIZATION> , the senior coalition partner , immediately dismissed the <ORGANIZATION>National Unity Party</ORGANIZATION> ( <ORGANIZATION>PUNR</ORGANIZATION> ) demand as crude electioneering .</S>
<S>" It is a desperate move by the <ORGANIZATION>PUNR</ORGANIZATION> , which is losing its only reason for existing ahead of the electoral campaign , " said <ORGANIZATION>PDSR</ORGANIZATION> executive president <PERSON>Adrian Nastase</PERSON> .</S>
<S>" This treaty is both necessary and good , " <PERSON>Nastase</PERSON> said , adding that the <ORGANIZATION>PUNR</ORGANIZATION>'s stance was threatening its position in the government .</S>
<S>The treaty agreed unexpectedly two weeks ago will end years of disputes over the status of <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s large ethnic Hungarian minority .</S>
<S>It will also boost both countries ' chances of admission to <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>European Union</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>" If they ( the <ORGANIZATION>PUNR</ORGANIZATION> ) are so vexed , they could leave the government ...</S>
<S>We might also help them to do it , if they go on like this , " he said .</S>
<S>The <ORGANIZATION>PUNR</ORGANIZATION> holds four key ministries -- justice , transport , agriculture and communications .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>PUNR</ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON>Gheorghe Funar</PERSON> said in a statement <PERSON>Iliescu</PERSON> , in power since the fall of communism in 1989 , should be impeached for treason for compromising on the issue of ethnic Hungarian minority rights in the treaty due to be signed next month .</S>
<S><PERSON>Funar</PERSON>'s call came on the eve of the official launch of <PERSON>Iliescu</PERSON>'s campaign for a new term at November 3 polls .</S>
<S>His appeal to the opposition to back his attempt to oust <PERSON>Iliescu</PERSON> was unlikely to succeed , analysts said .</S>
<S><PERSON>Iliescu</PERSON> has invited political leaders to a meeting on Thursday to discuss the final form of the pact which both Romanian and Hungarian nationalists oppose for different reasons .</S>
<S>Presidential officials were not available to comment on the call for <PERSON>Iliescu</PERSON>'s impeachment .</S>

<S>Estonian MPS see little hope of electing president .</S>

<S><LOCATION>TALLINN</LOCATION> 1996-08-27</S>
<S><LOCATION>Estonia</LOCATION>'s parliament failed for a second time to elect a president on Tuesday , dealing a blow to incumbent <PERSON>Lennart Meri</PERSON> and pushing the country towards stalemate in its choice of a new head of state .</S>
<S>Neither <PERSON>Meri</PERSON> , who oversaw <LOCATION>Estonia</LOCATION>'s first steps into statehood after the collapse of the <LOCATION>Soviet Union</LOCATION> , nor his arch-rival , former communist <PERSON>Arnold Ruutel</PERSON> , have secured the 68 votes necessary from the 101-member parliament .</S>
<S><PERSON>Meri</PERSON> garnered 49 votes and <PERSON>Meri</PERSON> 34 in Tuesday's ballot for the five-year presidency of <LOCATION>Estonia</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>A third and final vote was due to be held when parliament reconvened on Tuesday but legislators were not expecting a clear result .</S>
<S>If there is no result the decision will be ceded to an electoral college .</S>
<S>" The votes are a strong message to <PERSON>Meri</PERSON> that he is not favoured by some politicians any more , " <ORGANIZATION>Reform Party</ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON>Heiki Kranich</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>Under a constitution agreed in 1992 , a year after independence , the president has no executive powers .</S>
<S>His only political role is to smoothe the functioning of government in periods of crisis .</S>
<S>But <PERSON>Meri</PERSON> , 67 , has been accused in parliament of taking too much power and not always consulting parliamentarians before making decisions .</S>
<S>His relations with a leftist-led government have sometimes been tense .</S>
<S>His support in the first round of voting on Monday was much lower than expected , scoring only 45 votes , which political analysts put down as a vote of no confidence in his performance .</S>
<S>This support only inched up to 49 in the second vote .</S>
<S>Support for <PERSON>Ruutel</PERSON> , 68 , remained constant at 34 votes .</S>
<S>If the third vote fails to give either <PERSON>Meri</PERSON> or <PERSON>Ruutel</PERSON> 68 votes , the parliamentary speaker will convene an electoral college of 101 MPs and 273 local goverment representatives to hold a new poll that could include new nominations .</S>
<S>This would be the first time that the former Soviet republic has had to call together an electoral college .</S>
<S>In its first presidential election in 1992 <PERSON>Meri</PERSON> won the necessary votes in in a parliamentary election against <PERSON>Ruutel</PERSON> .</S>
<S>Parliamentary organisers said the exact timetable remained unclear but it would probably take about a month to organise an electoral college which could also hold several rounds of voting before a clear winner emerges .</S>

<S>The final decision will now be made by a larger assembly .</S>

<S><PERSON>SAO PAULO</PERSON> 1996-08-27</S>
<S><LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION> is likely to turn <LOCATION>Sao Paulo</LOCATION> state bank <ORGANIZATION>Banespa</ORGANIZATION> into a federal bank in a prior step to privatization , according to unnamed government sources , <ORGANIZATION>O Globo</ORGANIZATION> daily said .</S>
<S>The newspaper said the <ORGANIZATION>Central Bank</ORGANIZATION> special administration of <ORGANIZATION>Banespa</ORGANIZATION> ends in December 30 and after that the bank has to be liquidated or turned into a federal bank since there are no conditions to return <ORGANIZATION>Banespa</ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION>Sao Paulo</LOCATION> state government .</S>
<S>A <ORGANIZATION>Central Bank</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said he could not confirm or deny the report .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Banespa</ORGANIZATION> has been under central bank special temporary administration since December 1994 .</S>
<S>The central bank management could be lifted if <LOCATION>Sao Paulo</LOCATION> state decided to take part in the recent federal government's plan to restructure state banks .</S>
<S>Under the plan , the federal government would provide 100 percent of the financing needed to restructure debt of state banks being privatized , liquidated or turned into development banks .</S>
<S>It also offers to refinance up to 50 percent of the debt held by state banks whose governments decide to keep control of their banks .</S>
<S>Although the plan was designed under terms proposed by <LOCATION>Sao Paulo</LOCATION> state governor <PERSON>Mario Covas</PERSON> , he has showed no interest in taking part in the plan because <LOCATION>Sao Paulo</LOCATION>'s debt with <ORGANIZATION>Banespa</ORGANIZATION> has increased sharply , <ORGANIZATION>O Globo</ORGANIZATION> said .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Sao Paulo</LOCATION> state's debt is now estimated at 19 billion reais .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>O Globo</ORGANIZATION> also said another delicate case to be solved involves private bank <ORGANIZATION>Bamerindus</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>The newspaper said <ORGANIZATION>Bamerindus</ORGANIZATION> has sent to the <ORGANIZATION>Central Bank</ORGANIZATION> a proposal for restructuring combined with a request for a 90-day credit line , paying four percent a year plus the Basic Interest Rate of the <ORGANIZATION>Central Bank</ORGANIZATION> ( <ORGANIZATION>TBC</ORGANIZATION> ) .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>O Globo</ORGANIZATION> also said the loan would give <ORGANIZATION>Bamerindus</ORGANIZATION> time to sell assets .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Bamerindus</ORGANIZATION> , <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s fourth-largest private bank , has been facing liquidity troubles .</S>

<S><PERSON>Lanusse</PERSON> died after being brought to a hospital a week ago following a fall at home that resulted in a blood clot in the brain .</S>
<S>He was operated on earlier in the week but failed to recover from surgery .</S>
<S>The former dictator , who ruled from 1971 to 1973 , was best known for allowing <PERSON>Juan Domingo Peron</PERSON> , <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION>'s famed populist leader , to return to <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> after 17 years of forced exile .</S>

<S>But unlike his two predecessors , <PERSON>Juan Carlos</PERSON> Ongania and <PERSON>Marcelo Levingston</PERSON> , who ruled <LOCATION>Argentina</LOCATION> with an iron hand , <PERSON>Lanusse</PERSON> steered the country toward democracy .</S>
<S>That resulted in general elections in March 1973 when the <ORGANIZATION>Peronists</ORGANIZATION> led by <PERSON>Hector Campora</PERSON> and <PERSON>Vicente Solano Lima</PERSON> returned to power .</S>
<S><PERSON>Lanusse</PERSON> was a candidate in the election but failed to defeat his old adversories and never returned to public office .</S>
<S>He was imprisoned for four years in 1951 for taking part in a coup attempt to overthrow <PERSON>Peron</PERSON> led by General <PERSON>Benjamin Menendez</PERSON> .</S>
<S><PERSON>Lanusse</PERSON>'s rule saw the gradual rise of left-wing activism which culminated in another period of brutal Argentine dictatorship from 1976 to 1983 , during which the military launched its " dirty war " that resulted in 10,000 missing people .</S>
<S>In his autobiography published in 1990 , <PERSON>Lanusse</PERSON> described himself as a military man with " democratic ideas . "</S>

<S>A new <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> relief coordinator has arrived in <LOCATION>Baghdad</LOCATION> to take up the task of organising humanitarian goods distribution and to face <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>'s continuing opposition over the number of international monitors to be involved .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> and diplomatic sources said on Tuesday that Secretary- General <PERSON>Boutros Boutros-Ghali</PERSON> had appointed Italian <PERSON>Gualtiero Fulcheri</PERSON> and sent him to <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> last week to replace Moroccan <PERSON>Mohamed Zejjari</PERSON> .</S>
<S>One diplomat said <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> were still in disagreement on how many international observers would be required to ascertain the equitable distribution of humanitarian supplies that will be procured under <LOCATION>Baghdad</LOCATION>'s oil deal with U.N .</S>
<S>" The <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> would like to employ hundreds of foreign monitors .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Baghdad</LOCATION> says it can only accept a few dozens , " said the diplomat .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Baghdad</LOCATION> holds that the Iraq-U.N. memorandum of understanding on partial oil sales signed last June does not specify how many foreign observers should be stationed in <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>" Observation of food supplies and their distribution are still a major issue and seems the two sides have not yet filled the gap separating them , " said another diplomat .</S>

<S>Anti-abortion speaker praises Democrat tolerance .</S>
<S><PERSON>Alan Elsner</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>CHICAGO</LOCATION> 1996-08-27</S>
<S>An anti-abortion politician addressed the Democratic convention on Tuesday , but praised the overwhelmingly pro-abortion rights party for its tolerance of his minority views .</S>
<S>Rep .</S>
<S><PERSON>Tony Hall</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Ohio</LOCATION> said he and other Democrats who opposed abortion had always felt left out in their own party .</S>
<S>" But this year is different .</S>
<S>For the first time , the <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> has included in our platform a conscience clause , " he said .</S>
<S>The clause recognizes and welcomes Democrats with divergent views on abortion and states they have a full part to play at all levels of the party .</S>
<S>" The <ORGANIZATION>Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> is indeed the party of true inclusiveness , " <PERSON>Hall</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>At its convention four years ago , organizers prevented then <LOCATION>Pennsylvania</LOCATION> Gov .</S>
<S><PERSON>Robert Casey</PERSON> , a vehement opponent of abortion , from speaking .</S>
<S>Republicans have used their decision as an example of Democrat intolerance ever since .</S>
<S><PERSON>Casey</PERSON> told a news conference in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> on Tuesday he had asked to speak again this year but was turned down .</S>
<S>Democratic leaders said there was not room on the program for every retired governor to speak .</S>
<S>" I believe the Democratic party ought to be pro-woman , pro-child and pro-life , " <PERSON>Casey</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>" I asked for the opportunity to deliver this message from the podium of the <ORGANIZATION>Democrat National Convention</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>For the second time in four years , my request fell on deaf ears , " he said .</S>
<S>The <ORGANIZATION>Republican Party</ORGANIZATION> , whose platform calls for making all abortions illegal , faced a similar dilemma this year when <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> Gov .</S>
<S><PERSON>William Weld</PERSON> asked to deliver a speech defending abortion rights and was turned down .</S>
<S><PERSON>Bob Dole</PERSON> , the Republican presidential nominee , tried and failed to insert a tolerance clause in his party's platform recognizing the validity of those within the party who supported abortion rights .</S>
<S>Democrats also heard Tuesday two passionate speeches defending abortion rights .</S>
<S><PERSON>Kate Michelman</PERSON> , president of the <ORGANIZATION>National Abortion Rights Action League</ORGANIZATION> , described how she had an abortion at a time when the procedure was illegal after her husband abandoned her with three young children .</S>
<S>" I'm here to speak up for choice and to speak for truth .</S>
<S>The message from the <ORGANIZATION>Republican Party</ORGANIZATION> is one of disdain .</S>

<S>A spokesman for <PERSON>Masood</PERSON> said he had told the <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Republican at a meeting in northern <LOCATION>Kabul</LOCATION> that President <PERSON>Burhanuddin Rabbani</PERSON>'s government favoured talks with all Afghan factions to set up an interim government .</S>
<S>The factions should agree to appoint a transitional leader , draft a new constitution , collect heavy weapons , create a national army and hold free elections in which the transitional leader would be barred from standing , he added .</S>
<S><PERSON>Rohrabacher</PERSON> flew into <LOCATION>Bagram</LOCATION> military airbase north of <LOCATION>Kabul</LOCATION> in a <ORGANIZATION>Red Cross</ORGANIZATION> plane on Tuesday after meeting northern opposition militia leader General <PERSON>Abdul Rashid Dostum</PERSON> .</S>
<S><PERSON>Masood</PERSON>'s spokesman <PERSON>Amrollah</PERSON> ( one name ) said <PERSON>Rohrabacher</PERSON> had recently visited <LOCATION>Italy</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Saudi Arabia</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> as part of a mission to promote peace in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>" We are certainly serious more than before to find a solution to the Afghan problem and support every <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> plan , " <PERSON>Amrollah</PERSON> quoted <PERSON>Rohrabacher</PERSON> as saying .</S>

<S>" <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> wants to block the establishment of a strong Islamic government in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> intends to neutralise the Afghan peace process initiated by the Afghans themselves , " said the spokesman , <PERSON>Hamid Ibrahimi</PERSON> .</S>
<S>" A great game has been started in <LOCATION>Afghanistan</LOCATION> as <LOCATION>America</LOCATION> feels that <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> have got stronger in the Afghan picture -- something <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> wants to change , " he said .</S>
<S><PERSON>Rohrabacher</PERSON> was expected to visit neutral faction leaders in the eastern city of <LOCATION>Jalalabad</LOCATION> and meet leaders of the rebel Islamic Taleban militia in the southern city of <LOCATION>Kandahar</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>Afghan guerrilla factions have been locked in a bloody power struggle since the fall of the communist government in April 1992 .</S>

<S>" Since the Brady Law went into effect on February 28 , 1994 ( it ) has stopped more than 100,000 convicted felons and other prohibited purchasers from buying a handgun .</S>

<S>She added , " But we need to do more .</S>
<S>We should , as President <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> proposed today , stop people convicted of domestic violence from buying a handgun .</S>
<S><PERSON>Jim</PERSON> and I join with you tonight in saluting the great job that President <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> has done in fighting crime and gun violence . "</S>

<S><LOCATION>STANSTED</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> 1996-08-27</S>
<S>A hijacked <ORGANIZATION>Sudan Airways</ORGANIZATION> plane carrying 199 passengers and crew landed at <LOCATION>Stansted</LOCATION> airport just outside <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> early on Tuesday morning after flying from <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION> , eyewitnesses said .</S>
<S>The Airbus 310 Flight 150 , which was hijacked on Monday evening on its way from <LOCATION>Khartoum</LOCATION> to the Jordanian capital <LOCATION>Amman</LOCATION> , landed at 4.30 a.m. ( 0330 GMT ) after a flight of more than four hours .</S>
<S>At least one of the unidentified hijackers was apparently armed with grenades and TNT and threatened to blow the plane up in <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION> unless it was refuelled so they could fly to <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> to claim political asylum .</S>
<S>" They will surrender the passengers there and surrender themselves , " police spokesman <PERSON>Glafcos Xenos</PERSON> told reporters at <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Larnaca</LOCATION> airport .</S>
<S>Security was tight at <LOCATION>Stansted</LOCATION> airport , which is about 30 miles ( 50 km ) northeast of the capital .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Stansted</LOCATION> has been designated as the preferred option for handling hijackings in southern <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> because it is more remote than <LOCATION>Heathrow</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Gatwick</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s two major airports , and handles less air traffic .</S>

<S>A hijacked <ORGANIZATION>Sudan Airways</ORGANIZATION> plane with 199 passengers and crew on board was expected to land at <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Stansted</LOCATION> airport later on Tuesday morning , a police spokeswoman said .</S>
<S>" That is the plan at the moment .</S>
<S>That is where the plane is being directed to , " <PERSON>Ruth Collin</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Essex</LOCATION> police , the force responsible for <LOCATION>Stansted</LOCATION> , said .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Stansted</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>London</LOCATION>'s third-busiest airport after <LOCATION>Heathrow</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Gatwick</LOCATION> , is located about 30 miles ( 48 km ) northeast of the capital .</S>
<S>British officials said they would much prefer to deal with a hijacking at <LOCATION>Stansted</LOCATION> because of its relatively remote location and because air traffic would be less badly disrupted there than at <LOCATION>Heathrow</LOCATION> or <LOCATION>Gatwick</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>They said police and the emergency services were implementing a well-rehearsed contingency plan to handle the hijacking .</S>
<S>The armed hijackers of the Airbus 310 Flight 150 , which is expected to arrive about 4 a.m. ( 0300 GMT ) , have said they intend to surrender and seek political asylum in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>The plane was hijacked on its way from <LOCATION>Khartoum</LOCATION> to the Jordanian capital <LOCATION>Amman</LOCATION> on Monday evening and landed at <LOCATION>Larnaca</LOCATION> airport in <LOCATION>Cyprus</LOCATION> to refuel .</S>
<S>The identity and number of the hijackers was not known .</S>

<S>Painted parrot scam lands Australian in jail .</S>
<S><LOCATION>PERTH</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Australia</LOCATION> 1996-08-27</S>
<S>A conman who painted common Australian parrots with dye to make them look like rare birds worth thousands of dollars was jailed for fraud on Tuesday .</S>
<S><PERSON>Denham Peiris</PERSON> painted six green parrots , worth about A$ 100 ( US$ 79 ) a pair , with a cinnamon hair dye and traded them as Indian Ringneck Parrots , valued at A$ 14,000 a pair .</S>
<S><PERSON>Peiris</PERSON> , 32 , of <LOCATION>Perth</LOCATION> , was sentenced in the Western Australian District Court to two years in jail for fraud after trading three pairs of impostor birds for 21 parrots worth a total of A$ 28,000 .</S>
<S>" Everyone was fooled , " said pet shop owner <PERSON>Shane Drew</PERSON> , who unknowingly traded the disguised birds .</S>
<S>" I'd already had three local breeders have a look at them and sent photos and videos of the birds to the eastern states for authentication -- they said they're nice birds , " <PERSON>Drew</PERSON> told reporters outside court .</S>
<S>" After I was told they were dyed , I checked them over again .</S>
<S>It was a perfect paint job except for one feather under a wing of one bird that was only half dyed , " <PERSON>Drew</PERSON> said .</S>
<S><PERSON>Drew</PERSON> said <PERSON>Peiris</PERSON> , a bird enthusiast , would have succeeded with the fraud if he had not tried to trade a fourth pair of bogus birds after an associate had told police of the scam .</S>
<S>If not for the informant , the painted parrots ' true colours would not have been known for six months , he said .</S>
<S>" They moult in the summer , so five or six months down the track , I would have looked like the guilty party , " <PERSON>Drew</PERSON> said .</S>

<S>Nuclear pact will be a step to disarmament-China .</S>
<S><LOCATION>BEIJING</LOCATION> 1996-08-27</S>
<S><LOCATION>China</LOCATION> on Tuesday reaffirmed its support for a global nuclear test ban treaty blocked by <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> last week , saying the pact would be an important step in achieving total nuclear disarmament .</S>
<S>" Although the final draft of the treaty probably didn't totally satisfy any country , it was in general balanced , " the official <ORGANIZATION>People's Daily</ORGANIZATION> newspaper said in a commentary .</S>
<S><LOCATION>India</LOCATION> blocked the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) at the Conference on Disarmament in <LOCATION>Geneva</LOCATION> , saying the pact did not contain a clause committing the five declared nuclear powers to a timetable for nuclear disarmament .</S>
<S><LOCATION>New Delhi</LOCATION>'s stance , which was seen as effectively thwarting 2-1/2 years of negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament , drew widespread but generally muted foreign criticism .</S>
<S><LOCATION>India</LOCATION> has also pledged to oppose any forwarding of the draft treaty to the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations General Assembly</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S><LOCATION>China</LOCATION> said many countries had compromised to complete the treaty and that the issue of a disarmament schedule could be discussed in future negotiations .</S>
<S>" The completion of the test ban treaty would be an important and practical step in the gradual process of achieving total nuclear disarmament , " it said .</S>
<S><LOCATION>China</LOCATION> has pledged support for the pact since reaching a deal with the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> that made international inspections of nuclear sites more difficult than in earlier drafts of the accord .</S>
<S>The newspaper said <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> advocated the complete ban and destruction of nuclear weapons but that there was little hope other nuclear powers would soon adopt the same stance .</S>
<S>" Some nuclear powers stubbornly uphold policies of nuclear deterrence based on first use of nuclear weapons , " it said .</S>
<S><LOCATION>China</LOCATION> held on July 29 what it said would be its last nuclear test before a self-imposed moratorium that took effect the following day .</S>
<S><LOCATION>China</LOCATION> was the last declared nuclear power to announce a halt to testing .</S>

<S><LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> declares food poisoning threat receding .</S>
<S><LOCATION>TOKYO</LOCATION> 1996-08-27</S>
<S>The government said on Tuesday that the threat from a mysterious killer germ , while still requiring vigilance , appears to be receding in the western <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> city of <LOCATION>Sakai</LOCATION> , where the epidemic hit the hardest .</S>
<S>The food poisoning epidemic caused by the O-157 colon bacillus in <LOCATION>Sakai</LOCATION> appears to be " settling down " , Health Minister <PERSON>Naoto Kan</PERSON> was quoted by a government spokesman as telling the cabinet .</S>
<S>The O-157 colon bacillus has been found responsible for a widespread food poisoning epidemic that has killed 11 people and made over 9,500 ill this year .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Sakai</LOCATION> , near the regional commercial centre of <LOCATION>Osaka</LOCATION> , has been hit hardest by the deadly bacteria , with nearly 6,500 , mostly schoolchildren , affected by the disease .</S>
<S>Two children in <LOCATION>Sakai</LOCATION> have died from complications associated with the bacteria .</S>
<S><PERSON>Kan</PERSON> told a cabinet meeting on Tuesday that no new victims have been reported since August 8 , indicating that the peak has passed , at least for <LOCATION>Sakai</LOCATION> .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Sakai</LOCATION> officials agreed with the assessment , but said it was too early to feel relieved .</S>
<S>" There are still patients hospitalised and problems which must be dealt with , " a city spokesman said , citing the issue of whether to allow children infected with the bacteria but not showing symptoms to attend school from September .</S>
<S>Health authorities believe school lunches were the source of the food poisoning in <LOCATION>Sakai</LOCATION> , but researchers have been unable to pinpoint the exact source of the infection .</S>
<S>The outbreak has prompted authorities to tighten sanitary standards at slaughterhouses and meatpacking plants and sparked calls for an overhaul of the nation's school lunch programme .</S>
<S>The ministers agreed at Tuesday's cabinet meeting to step up inspection measures for school lunches in September and October , when schools around the country resume .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Ministry</ORGANIZATION> also announced that it will compile hygiene guidelines based on <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> government methods of checking the safety of farm produce to prevent another outbreak of the epidemic .</S>
<S>As of Monday , 31 children were still hospitalised in <LOCATION>Sakai</LOCATION> city , of whom six were in serious condition .</S>

<S>Japanese shipments of aluminium mill products in July surged 8.9 percent over the same month last year to 224,609 tonnes , while production rose 6.4 percent to 222,457 tonnes , according to preliminary data released on Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION>Japan Aluminium Federation</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>The surge reflected strong demand from the beverage can and housing construction sectors , federation officials said .</S>
<S>Figures released two weeks ago from <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s seven largest mills already showed that <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION>'s can sheet output reached its highest monthly level ever in July , reflecting above-average temperatures that sparked a jump in beer consumption .</S>

<S>July inventories stood at 75,632 tonnes , down 2.6 percent from the prior month .</S>
<S>July foil output was off 0.2 percent year-on-year at 11,525 tonnes , while foil shipments fell 0.8 percent to 11,244 tonnes .</S>

<S>Palestinian leaders in <LOCATION>Jerusalem</LOCATION> called on Tuesday for a two-hour strike to protest what they called <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>'s war on <LOCATION>Arab East Jerusalem</LOCATION> after police demolished a building there .</S>
<S>Israeli police demolished a 10 metre ( yard ) by 20 metre structure in <LOCATION>Jerusalem</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Old City</LOCATION> they said had been built with funding from the <ORGANIZATION>Palestinian self-rule Authority</ORGANIZATION> for use as a social club .</S>
<S>Police used a huge crane to lift a bulldozer over the <LOCATION>Old City</LOCATION>'s walls to reach the building amidst narrow alleys , witnesses said .</S>
<S>Bystanders at the scene said work had begun on the building in 1991 and it had yet to be completed when the Israeli police bulldozed it .</S>
<S>The <ORGANIZATION>Palestinian Authority</ORGANIZATION> was set up under the 1993 PLO-Israel interim peace deal .</S>
<S>" There has been a call for a general strike between one ( 1000 GMT ) and three o'clock , " Palestinian lawmaker <PERSON>Ahmed Hashem Zighayer</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>" This is a war that has been declared on us and we want our people to come and see the site where they declared the war . "</S>

<S><LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>'s previous government held the same position but in general turned a blind eye to <ORGANIZATION>Palestinian Authority</ORGANIZATION> activity in the city .</S>

<S><ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> adopts rules to improve investor access to best stock prices .</S>
<S><LOCATION>WASHINGTON</LOCATION> 1996-08-28</S>
<S>The <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> Wednesday approved rules designed to give stock market investors a better chance at getting the best price available for their orders .</S>
<S>The so-called order handling rules , which were proposed last September , were approved in a 4-0 vote .</S>
<S>The new rules will require specialists at stock exchanges and market makers on Nasdaq to allow customers to view price quotes from other electronic trading systems that may not be readily available to them .</S>
<S>The rules will also require that customer limit orders be displayed with prices better than those available in quotes publicly available at the time .</S>
<S>Specialists and market makers are companies or individuals recognised as qualified to maintain an orderly market in a stock .</S>
<S>In a limit order , investors specify the price at which they are willing to buy or sell , as opposed to a market order executed at prevailing prices .</S>
<S>" These rules are intended to empower all investors , by allowing their orders to compete on a level playing field , and by providing the disclosure they need to make informed decisions , " said <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON>Arthur Levitt</PERSON> .</S>
<S>The <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION>'s goal , he added , was to create " one system where one price could be available to everybody . "</S>
<S>The director of the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION>'s division of market regulation , <PERSON>Richard Lindsey</PERSON> , said <LOCATION>Wall Street</LOCATION> firms will probably need to spend about $ 7 million to carry out the improvements called for by the new rules .</S>
<S>In proposing the rules last year , the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> noted that while technology has improved , commonplace practices still existed that worked against investors ' best interests .</S>
<S>It noted that customers whose orders were not displayed lost the chance of getting the best possible price available in the market .</S>
<S>It also cited the potential problem of a two-tiered market in which market makers quote one price to public investors while quoting better prices in private systems , thus robbing investors without access to " hidden " quotes the benefit of the best available prices .</S>
<S>Earlier this month , the <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> settled charges of alleged malpractices on Nasdaq when the parent of the Nasdaq market , the <ORGANIZATION>National Association of Securities Dealers</ORGANIZATION> , agreed to spend $ 100 million over five years to upgrade its oversight of brokers ' trading practices .</S>
<S>The <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION> dropped a third proposal that would have allowed investors with market orders to trade at a better price if there were shifts in prices before their orders were executed .</S>
<S>The agency said it would monitor effects of the two new rules before considering the " price improvement " proposal again .</S>
<S>The agency also proposed rule changes that would require continuous " bid " and " ask " quotations from exchange specialists and market makers who trade more than 1 percent of a stock during any quarter on Nasdaq .</S>
<S>The <ORGANIZATION>SEC</ORGANIZATION>'s limit order display rule will mean a major change for Nasdaq , where such orders have never been displayed .</S>
<S>The president of the Nasdaq , <PERSON>Alfred Berkeley</PERSON> , was to hold a news conference Wednesday afternoon to elaborate on the new rules ' effects on the market , the second largest in the world .</S>

<S>ITALIAN CABINET APPROVES TELEVISION DECREE .</S>
<S><LOCATION>ROME</LOCATION> 1996-08-28</S>
<S>The Italian cabinet on Wednesday granted a reprieve for media mogul <PERSON>Silvio Berlusconi</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Mediaset</ORGANIZATION> television empire with a decree extending the current legal framework for television stations until January 31 , 1997 .</S>
<S>The decree plugs a legal void in which magistrates could have forced the former prime minister to take one of the three stations he controls off the air because of a court ruling that no single proprietor should be allowed to keep three channels .</S>

<S>Passengers injured in train collision in <LOCATION>Linz</LOCATION> .</S>
<S><LOCATION>LINZ</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Austria</LOCATION> 1996-08-28</S>
<S>A passenger train collided with a locomotive at a main railway station in <LOCATION>Linz</LOCATION> on Wednesday and police said around 10 people were injured .</S>
<S>Austrian television reported earlier that more than 20 had been hurt in the accident at the station in <LOCATION>Linz</LOCATION> , 300 km ( 180 miles ) west of <LOCATION>Vienna</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>" One locomotive was stationary and the passenger train collided into the back of it , " a police spokesman in <LOCATION>Linz</LOCATION> told <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION> by telephone .</S>
<S>The express passenger train travelling from <LOCATION>Steyr</LOCATION> , southeast of <LOCATION>Linz</LOCATION> , with around 80 people on board , hit the back of a service locomotive used to shunt wagons into sidings .</S>
<S>The police spokesman said he was not sure whether any more passengers were still trapped in the wreckage .</S>
<S>Doctors and medical staff from a hospital across the road from the station were at the scene of the accident within minutes and were able to treat the injured quickly , he added .</S>
<S>Greater damage was averted as the driver of the passenger train had time to apply his emergency brakes before the collision occurred , a state railways spokesman told Austrian news agency <ORGANIZATION>APA</ORGANIZATION> .</S>

<S><ORGANIZATION>Saskatchewan Wheat Pool</ORGANIZATION> eyes hog market .</S>
<S><LOCATION>WINNIPEG</LOCATION> 1996-08-28</S>
<S><LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s largest grain handling firm said Wednesday it expects to forge a partnership with hog farmers by 1997 with a view to expanding the company's scope into pork production .</S>
<S>" <LOCATION>Saskatchewan</LOCATION> is well positioned to take advantage of growing world markets for pork , " <ORGANIZATION>Saskatchewan Wheat Pool</ORGANIZATION> chief executive <PERSON>Don Loewen</PERSON> said in a company statement .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>SWP</ORGANIZATION> said it was analyzing potential partnerships with hog farmers and expected the first deal to be in place in 1997 .</S>
<S>The end of <LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s rail freight subsidy last year caused a shift in feed grain production to the eastern Prairie .</S>
<S>Analysts said livestock production would likely shift to the eastern Prairie rather than feed grains being shipped to the western Prairie .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>SWP</ORGANIZATION> said it may develop pork production systems that provide farmers with large integrated units , and it may consider contracting programs between producers and packers which would operate within the existing hog market framework .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Saskatchewan Pork International Marketing Group</ORGANIZATION> has an export monopoly but some <LOCATION>Saskatchewan</LOCATION> farmers earlier this month called for an open market in hogs .</S>

<S>TENNIS - SERIOUS <PERSON>MEDVEDEV</PERSON> IS HAVING FUN AGAIN .</S>
<S><PERSON>Richard Finn</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>NEW YORK</LOCATION> 1996-08-28</S>
<S>Outspoken <PERSON>Andrei Medvedev</PERSON> exchanged his reputation as the clown prince of tennis on Wednesday for a new no-nonsense attitude that has made life on the courts fun again .</S>
<S>" I think I'm much more focused on what I have to do , and that's playing tennis , " <PERSON>Medvedev</PERSON> said after routing Frenchman <PERSON>Jean-Philippe Fleurian</PERSON> 6-2 6-0 6-1 in the opening round of the U.S. Open .</S>
<S>It was <PERSON>Medvedev</PERSON>'s sixth victory in a row after winning his first tournament of the year last week at the Hamlet Cup .</S>
<S>" I realised this year , that without putting 99.9 percent of your mind into tennis , I don't think you can successful , " said the 22-year-old <PERSON>Medvedev</PERSON> .</S>
<S>" The whole day I'm thinking abnout tennis .</S>
<S>I felt that all the other things I was doing the years before , they were distracting me , they were not helping me at all . "</S>
<S>For <PERSON>Medvedev</PERSON> that meant confining his post-match comments to tennis and not going off on tirades about about peripheral issues such as the poor quality of food in the players lounge , an entertaining rant that took his mind off the task at hand .</S>
<S>" I know what I'm here for , " said <PERSON>Medvedev</PERSON> , who lost in the second round of the Open the last two years after reaching the quarters in 1993 , the same year he tried his hand as a restaurant critic .</S>
<S>" I'm not here to fight the press or talk about the food or entertain the people off the court .</S>
<S>I'm here to play tennis and to win .</S>
<S>I have much less fun off the court .</S>
<S>I have much more fun on the court , " he said .</S>
<S>Just three years ago <PERSON>Medvedev</PERSON> was one of the world's best , with a ranking of six after reaching the French Open semifinal and winning three tournaments .</S>
<S>But <PERSON>Medvedev</PERSON>'s ranking slowly began to drop last year as he struggled with a wrist injury .</S>
<S>The Ukrainian finally hit a low of 44th two months ago .</S>
<S>" It's somewhere where I wouldn't like to stay very long , " <PERSON>Medvedev</PERSON> said of his current ranking of 36 . "</S>
<S>It's a part of the penalty that I have to accept . "</S>
<S>As part of his new businesslike approach , <PERSON>Medvedev</PERSON> hired Australian coach <PERSON>Bob Brett</PERSON> at the start of this year and the partnership is beginning to pay off .</S>
<S>" At the beginning of the year we started from zero , " said <PERSON>Medvedev</PERSON> . "</S>
<S>Winning in <LOCATION>Long Island</LOCATION> ( last week ) was like winning for the first time . "</S>
<S>While <PERSON>Medvedev</PERSON>'s 77-minute romp past <PERSON>Fleurian</PERSON> was rather ordinary , the fact that the two were playing each other was rather remarkable .</S>
<S>In the original draw , <PERSON>Medvedev</PERSON> and <PERSON>Fleurian</PERSON> were slotted to play each other .</S>
<S>When controversy forced the draw to be done over -- against odds of 151-to-1 -- <PERSON>Medvedev</PERSON> and <PERSON>Fleurian</PERSON> drew each other a second time .</S>
<S>" When I saw the new draw I didn't have to change my preparation , " <PERSON>Medvedev</PERSON> said . "</S>
<S>I think it's destined that it turned out for me . "</S>

<S>TENNIS - <PERSON>GRAF</PERSON> WORKS HARD FOR FIRST-ROUND WIN .</S>
<S><PERSON>Bill Berkrot</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>NEW YORK</LOCATION> 1996-08-27</S>
<S>It wasn't supposed to be this hard for defending champion <PERSON>Steffi Graf</PERSON> to win her opening match at the U.S. Open on Tuesday night .</S>
<S>But the script that called for the usual first-round demolition by the top-ranked top seed was rewritten by 29th-ranked Indonesian <PERSON>Yayuk Basuki</PERSON> playing with nothing to lose abandon .</S>
<S><PERSON>Graf</PERSON> , of course , prevailed 6-3 7-6 , but not before some tense moments that even had the German superstar thinking the match was going three sets .</S>
<S>" I won the second set , which I didn't think I would do , being down 5-2 and the chances she had at 6-5 , " <PERSON>Graf</PERSON> recalled .</S>
<S>Several of the other women's seeds eased into the second round with more typical Graf-like efficiency Tuesday .</S>
<S>As afternoon turned to evening , fourth-seeded Spaniard <PERSON>Conchita Martinez</PERSON> took apart Romanian <PERSON>Ruxandra Dragomir</PERSON> in 58 minutes with the loss of just two games , one more than second seed <PERSON>Monica Seles</PERSON> , who opened the second-day programme by crushing American <PERSON>Anne Miller</PERSON> 6-0 6-1 .</S>
<S>Third seed <PERSON>Arantxa Sanchez Vicario</PERSON> , the 1994 champion , and eighth-seeded Olympic gold medalist <PERSON>Lindsay Davenport</PERSON> dropped three game each en route to the second round .</S>
<S>But the day was not without its seeded casualties on the women's side .</S>
<S>Fifth-seed <PERSON>Iva Majoli</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Croatia</LOCATION> was picked off by Austrian <PERSON>Judith Wiesner</PERSON> and Wimbledon semifinalist <PERSON>Kimiko Date</PERSON> of <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> , the 10th seed , fell 6-2 7-5 to 53rd-ranked American <PERSON>Kimberly Po</PERSON> .</S>
<S><PERSON>Date</PERSON>'s defeat left no other seeded players in <PERSON>Seles</PERSON>'s quarter of the draw , which lost <PERSON>Anke Huber</PERSON> ( 6 ) and <PERSON>Maggie Maleeva</PERSON> ( 12 ) on Monday .</S>
<S>But <PERSON>Graf</PERSON> , winner of 20 Grand Slam titles , was not about to join that list .</S>
<S>" At some points I felt a little nervous , " she admitted . "</S>
<S>When it came down to the important points , I felt more confident . "</S>
<S><PERSON>Basuki</PERSON> , a first-round loser here for the fifth consecutive year , was clearly going for winners , hitting the lines and running <PERSON>Graf</PERSON> around the court as she broke the top seed twice in the second set to grab that shocking 5-2 lead .</S>
<S><PERSON>Graf</PERSON> ran off the next three games to restore some semblance of order .</S>
<S>But <PERSON>Basuki</PERSON> , her long black ponytail flying as she raced for shots , held her serve and twice had set point on <PERSON>Graf</PERSON>'s serve at 6-5 before the German unleashed a forehand pass to force the tie-break .</S>
<S>" I lost the moment , " lamented <PERSON>Basuki</PERSON> , who has reached the fourth round at <LOCATION>Wimbledon</LOCATION> four times and was a semifinalist in <LOCATION>Montreal</LOCATION> earlier this month .</S>
<S>Still , the feisty Indonesian got off to a 3-0 lead in the tie-breaker before a pair of costly double faults gave <PERSON>Graf</PERSON> her chance to avoid a third set .</S>
<S>" Usually in the first one or two matches , you want to find your rhythm and want to get into it , " said <PERSON>Graf</PERSON> , who won seven of the last eight points in the breaker .</S>
<S>" To be in that situation today , a couple of times having to play well , get down and play point-by-point , definitely is a good start . "</S>

<S><ORGANIZATION>Chicago Cubs</ORGANIZATION> right fielder <PERSON>Sammy Sosa</PERSON> underwent surgery on Monday to remove a fractured bone from his right hand and will miss four to six weeks , the club announced Tuesday .</S>
<S><PERSON>Sosa</PERSON> , a leading candidate for National League Most Valuable Player honours , was injured August 20th when he was hit by a <PERSON>Mark Hutton</PERSON> pitch in the first inning of an 8-1 victory over the <ORGANIZATION>Florida Marlins</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>The 27-year-old <PERSON>Sosa</PERSON> leads the league with 40 homers and is tied for 10th with 100 RBI .</S>
<S>The loss of <PERSON>Sosa</PERSON> , who appeared in all 124 games this season , is a huge blow to the <ORGANIZATION>Cubs</ORGANIZATION> ' playoff hopes .</S>

<S>SOCCER - <PERSON>MARCELO</PERSON> HAT-TRICK KEEPS <ORGANIZATION>PSV</ORGANIZATION> AT TOP OF DUTCH LEAGUE .</S>
<S><LOCATION>AMSTERDAM</LOCATION> 1996-08-28</S>
<S>Brazilian striker <PERSON>Marcelo</PERSON> scored a hat-trick as <ORGANIZATION>PSV Eindhoven</ORGANIZATION> maintained their 100 percent record and stayed on top of the Dutch first division with a 3-1 win at <LOCATION>Volendam</LOCATION> on Wednesday .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>PSV</ORGANIZATION>'s main rivals for the title , defending champions <ORGANIZATION>Ajax Amsterdam</ORGANIZATION> , celebrated the novelty of having the roof of their new 51,000 seat stadium closed against the rain , with a 1-0 win over <ORGANIZATION>AZ Alkmaar</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Ajax</ORGANIZATION> were missing six first-team players but <PERSON>Frank de Boer</PERSON> shot home the winner from a 20-metre free kick in the 30th minute of a dull game .</S>
<S><PERSON>Marcelo</PERSON> , signed in close season to replace compatriot <PERSON>Ronaldo</PERSON> who left to play for <ORGANIZATION>Barcelona</ORGANIZATION> , opened the <ORGANIZATION>PSV</ORGANIZATION> scoring in the 19th minute when he fired home after good work from <PERSON>Rene Eijkelkamp</PERSON> .</S>
<S>The Brazilian found the mark again two minutes after halftime and again in the 56th minute before midfielder <PERSON>Pascal Jongsma</PERSON> scored a consolation goal for <ORGANIZATION>Volendam</ORGANIZATION> five minutes from time .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Feyenoord Rotterdam</ORGANIZATION> suffered an early shock when they went 1-0 down after four minutes against de <ORGANIZATION>Graafschap Doetinchem</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>The equaliser came in the 73rd minute when Swedish international <PERSON>Henke Larsson</PERSON> scored from close range and 10 minutes later <PERSON>Jean-Paul van Gastel</PERSON> gave <ORGANIZATION>Feyenoord</ORGANIZATION> a 2-1 victory from the penalty spot .</S>
<S>After three matches <ORGANIZATION>PSV</ORGANIZATION> lead the first division with nine points , three points clear of fifth-placed <ORGANIZATION>Ajax</ORGANIZATION> .</S>

<S>SOCCER - <PERSON>ROBSON</PERSON> WINS FIRST TROPHY WITH <ORGANIZATION>BARCELONA</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S><LOCATION>MADRID</LOCATION> 1996-08-28</S>
<S>Former <LOCATION>England</LOCATION> manager <PERSON>Bobby Robson</PERSON> enjoyed his first success in charge of <ORGANIZATION>Barcelona</ORGANIZATION> as his team weathered 90 minutes of non-stop <ORGANIZATION>Atletico Madrid</ORGANIZATION> pressure to win the Spanish Super Cup 6-5 on aggregate on Wednesday .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Barcelona</ORGANIZATION> had won the first leg 5-2 but the second leg was a different story .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Atletico</ORGANIZATION> came within a whisker of taking the Cup on the away-goal rule but squandered several chances after going 3-1 ahead 15 minutes from the end .</S>
<S><PERSON>Juan Lopez</PERSON> gave <ORGANIZATION>Atletico</ORGANIZATION> the lead midway through the first half after <ORGANIZATION>Barcelona</ORGANIZATION> fullback <PERSON>Albert Ferrer</PERSON> and substitute goalkeeper <PERSON>Julen Lopetegui</PERSON> failed to clear a <PERSON>Milinko Pantic</PERSON> cross .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Barcelona</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Hristo Stoichkov</PERSON> made his only significant contribution of the evening 10 minutes after halftime when <PERSON>Sergi Barjuan</PERSON> broke down the right to set up the fiery Bulgarian with a simple equaliser .</S>
<S>But <ORGANIZATION>Atletico</ORGANIZATION> struck back almost immediately through new signing <PERSON>Juan Eduardo Esnaider</PERSON> and then Serbian set-piece specialist <PERSON>Pantic</PERSON> made it 3-1 with a superb free-kick in the 75th minute .</S>
<S><PERSON>Robson</PERSON> praised <ORGANIZATION>Atletico</ORGANIZATION> after the game , which was played in the <LOCATION>Community of Madrid</LOCATION> athletic stadium because of pitch problems at the <PERSON>Vicente</PERSON> <LOCATION>Calderon</LOCATION> ground .</S>
<S>The venue of <ORGANIZATION>Atletico</ORGANIZATION>'s first league game , scheduled for Sunday , is still in doubt with the <ORGANIZATION>Real Madrid</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Santiago Bernabeu</LOCATION> a distinct possibility .</S>

<S>UEFA Cup hopefuls <ORGANIZATION>Parma</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Roma</ORGANIZATION> , under new coaches this season , crashed out of the Italian Cup to second division opponents on Wednesday while league champions <ORGANIZATION>Milan</ORGANIZATION> could only draw 1-1 at humble <ORGANIZATION>Empoli</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>Wealthy <ORGANIZATION>Parma</ORGANIZATION> , now coached by the former Italian international <PERSON>Carlo Ancelotti</PERSON> , were without new striker <PERSON>Enrico Chiesa</PERSON> and went down 3-1 at serie B club <ORGANIZATION>Pescara</ORGANIZATION> in their second round clash .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Pescara</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Ottavio Palladini</PERSON> shattered <ORGANIZATION>Parma</ORGANIZATION> with goals in the second and fourth minutes .</S>
<S>Midfielder <PERSON>Marco Giampaolo</PERSON> made it 3-0 in the 38th minute and <ORGANIZATION>Parma</ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON>Alessandro Melli</PERSON> pulled back a late goal six minutes from time .</S>
<S>The second round was the entry point for the bulk of the serie A sides with the winners going through .</S>
<S>The later stages of the cup are played over two legs .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Parma</ORGANIZATION>'s defeat was a repeat of last season's fiasco when they lost their opening cup match 3-0 to <ORGANIZATION>Palermo</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Roma</ORGANIZATION> , now coached by Argentine <PERSON>Carlos Bianchi</PERSON> and watched by Italian national coach <PERSON>Arrigo Sacchi</PERSON> , lost 3-1 to <ORGANIZATION>Cesena</ORGANIZATION> -- another repeat of last season when the <LOCATION>Rome</LOCATION> club also went out at the first hurdle .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Udinese</ORGANIZATION> , with <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION>'s Euro ' 96 hero <PERSON>Oliver Bierhoff</PERSON> in their lineup , completed the hat-trick of beaten serie A sides when they went under 2-1 to newly relegated <ORGANIZATION>Cremonese</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Milan</ORGANIZATION>'s new Uruguayan coach <PERSON>Oscar Tabarez</PERSON> avoided the nightmare of defeat but faces a replay at home next Sunday .</S>
<S>Cup holders <ORGANIZATION>Fiorentina</ORGANIZATION> easily beat <ORGANIZATION>Cosenza</ORGANIZATION> 3-1 while European Cup holders <ORGANIZATION>Juventus</ORGANIZATION> also cruised through with a 2-0 win at small southern club <ORGANIZATION>Fidelis Andria</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>Two other serie A sides lost at the weekend -- <ORGANIZATION>Piacenza</ORGANIZATION> and last year's losing finalists <ORGANIZATION>Atalanta</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>Two cup matches could not be played on Wednesday due to argument over first round results .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Lecce</ORGANIZATION>'s 3-0 weekend defeat of <ORGANIZATION>Genoa</ORGANIZATION> was expected to be overturned by a sporting judge on Thursday after the home club fielded an ineligible player .</S>
<S>That would set <ORGANIZATION>Genoa</ORGANIZATION> up for a second round match against local rivals <ORGANIZATION>Sampdoria</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Nocerina</ORGANIZATION>'s 4-3 defeat of <ORGANIZATION>Piacenza</ORGANIZATION> was also subject to a complaint , later removed , that forced their second round match against serie A newcomers <ORGANIZATION>Perugia</ORGANIZATION> to be delayed .</S>

<S>SOCCER - <PERSON>SMICER</PERSON>'s LAST-GASP GOAL KEEPS <ORGANIZATION>LENS</ORGANIZATION> IN THE LEAD .</S>
<S><LOCATION>PARIS</LOCATION> 1996-08-28</S>
<S>Euro 96 star <PERSON>Vladimir Smicer</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>Czech Republic</LOCATION> scored at the last second for <ORGANIZATION>Lens</ORGANIZATION> , allowing them to retain the lead in the French soccer league on Wednesday .</S>
<S><PERSON>Smicer</PERSON> pushed the ball home in injury time to lead his team to a 3-2 victory over <ORGANIZATION>Montpellier</ORGANIZATION> , who were leading 2-1 until <LOCATION>Cameroon</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Marc-Vivien Foe</PERSON> equalised on a header in the 85th minute .</S>
<S>The win was the fourth in as many matches this season for <ORGANIZATION>Lens</ORGANIZATION> , who lead the table on 12 points .</S>
<S>In-form <ORGANIZATION>Paris St Germain</ORGANIZATION> , who dismissed <ORGANIZATION>Nantes</ORGANIZATION> 1-0 , are second with 10 points .</S>
<S>Along with <PERSON>Smicer</PERSON> , <PERSON>Robert Pires</PERSON> was the star of the night in <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> , scoring the first hat-trick of the league season in <ORGANIZATION>Metz</ORGANIZATION>'s 3-1 home victory over neighbouring <ORGANIZATION>Strasbourg</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S><PERSON>Pires</PERSON> , one of the most promising strikers in the country , was called up for the first time this week by French manager <PERSON>Aime Jacquet</PERSON> for a friendly against <LOCATION>Mexico</LOCATION> on Saturday at the <LOCATION>Parc des Princes</LOCATION> .</S>
<S><PERSON>Pires</PERSON> scored first with a powerful shot in the 35th minute before striking again from close range just before the break .</S>
<S>A solitary raid allowed him to score his third in the 74th .</S>
<S><PERSON>Smicer</PERSON>'s goal was as hard-won as his team's victory .</S>
<S>Spurred by <PERSON>Foe</PERSON>'s leveller five minutes before , <ORGANIZATION>Lens</ORGANIZATION> pressed hard and <PERSON>Foe</PERSON> hit the crossbar in the dying seconds on another header .</S>
<S>The ball bounced back to <PERSON>Smicer</PERSON>'s feet and he scored .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Montpellier</ORGANIZATION> seized an unexpected lead thanks to <PERSON>Kader Ferhaoui</PERSON> in the fourth minute after a blunder from <ORGANIZATION>Lens</ORGANIZATION> goalkeeper <PERSON>Jean-Claude Nadon</PERSON> .</S>
<S>The side from northern <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> , forced to fight an uphill battle from then on , pulled level thanks to <PERSON>Tony Vairelles</PERSON> in the eighth minute but young striker <PERSON>Fabien Lefevre</PERSON> made it two for <ORGANIZATION>Montpellier</ORGANIZATION> five minutes later .</S>
<S>League favourites <ORGANIZATION>PSG</ORGANIZATION> scored a convincing 1-0 win over <ORGANIZATION>Nantes</ORGANIZATION> and confirmed they would again be the team to beat this season .</S>
<S>Ironically , <ORGANIZATION>PSG</ORGANIZATION>'s victory owed a lot to two former <ORGANIZATION>Nantes</ORGANIZATION> players , striker <PERSON>Patrice Loko</PERSON> , who scored on a brilliant shot in the 33rd minute , and defender <PERSON>Benoit Cauet</PERSON> , who started the one-two which allowed <PERSON>Loko</PERSON> to score .</S>
<S>The Parisians , who have yet to concede a goal , were without <LOCATION>Brazil</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Leonardo</PERSON> and <LOCATION>Panama</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Julio Cesar Dely Valdes</PERSON> , both called up by their national sides .</S>
<S>For <ORGANIZATION>Nantes</ORGANIZATION> , who shocked <ORGANIZATION>PSG</ORGANIZATION> to win the league crown two years ago , the fall is very painful .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>The Canaries</ORGANIZATION> , who lost most of their key players within two years , have yet to win a match this season .</S>
<S>Reigning champions <ORGANIZATION>Auxerre</ORGANIZATION> had to settle for a goalless draw against <ORGANIZATION>Marseille</ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday .</S>

<S><LOCATION>BONN</LOCATION> 1996-08-28</S>
<S>Organisers hope to persuade <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s former Olympic 100 metres champion <PERSON>Linford Christie</PERSON> to join a " <ORGANIZATION>Dream Team</ORGANIZATION> " sprint relay in a special tribute to <PERSON>Jesse Owens</PERSON> at Friday's <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> grand prix .</S>
<S><PERSON>Christie</PERSON> , who is retiring from international competition at the end of the season , was not due to compete in the German capital but <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> promoter <PERSON>Rudi Thiel</PERSON> said : " We are still hopeful of getting him to come . "</S>
<S><PERSON>Thiel</PERSON> has managed to get most of the Olympic 100 metres champions since 1948 to attend the meeting , which is being held in the stadium where <PERSON>Owens</PERSON> won four gold medals 60 years ago at the <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> Olympics .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Canada</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Donovan Bailey</PERSON> , the Olympic 100 metres champion and world record holder , and Namibian <PERSON>Frankie Fredericks</PERSON> , the silver medallist at the recent <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> Games , have already agreed to run in the 4X100 metres team .</S>
<S><PERSON>Thiel</PERSON> said on Wednesday that he had also asked Olympic 200 and 400 champion <PERSON>Michael Johnson</PERSON> to run as well as <PERSON>Christie</PERSON> .</S>
<S>" Most of the Olympic champions of the past are coming including <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s ( 1980 champion ) <PERSON>Allan Wells</PERSON> .</S>
<S><PERSON>Christie</PERSON> belongs to them .</S>
<S>It would be great to have him here .</S>
<S>" There is a good offer ....</S>
<S>My minimum would be that he just ran the relay , " he said .</S>
<S>The 36-year-old Briton is still considering the offer and is expected to announce his decision later on Wednesday .</S>
<S><PERSON>Owens</PERSON>'s widow <PERSON>Ruth</PERSON> is not well enough to attend but a message from her will be read out during the meeting and one of the sprinter's relatives is expected to attend .</S>
<S>The relay race , which will include squads from <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> , the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> as well as the <PERSON>Owens</PERSON> ' quartet , will be held at the end of the meeting .</S>
<S>Organisers had hoped to include 1984 and 1988 champion <PERSON>Carl Lewis</PERSON> in the squad but he injured himself in <LOCATION>Brussels</LOCATION> last Friday .</S>

<S><LOCATION>COLOMBO</LOCATION> 1996-08-28</S>
<S><PERSON>Sachin Tendulkar</PERSON> marked his debut as Indian captain with a patient 110 on Wednesday , but was upstaged by dashing Sri Lankan opener <PERSON>Sanath Jayasuriya</PERSON> whose 120 steered the world champions to a nine-wicket Singer Cup win .</S>

<S><LOCATION>South Africa</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Truth and Reconciliation Commission</ORGANIZATION> said on Wednesday it would subpoena persons accused of human rights violations to appear before it .</S>
<S>" We can subpoena anyone we want to , even the president of the country , " spokesman <PERSON>John Allen</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION> . "</S>
<S>Subpoenas are due to be served on a number of people this week . "</S>
<S>Media reports have speculated that the commission , which is trying to heal the wounds of apartheid by confronting the past , could subpoena apartheid-era President <PERSON>P.W. Botha</PERSON> and former police generals <PERSON>Basie Smit</PERSON> and <PERSON>Johan Van Der Merwe</PERSON> .</S>
<S>In submissions last week to the commission <ORGANIZATION>National Party</ORGANIZATION> leader and former president <PERSON>F.W. De Klerk</PERSON> said he had received no co-operation from <PERSON>Botha</PERSON> in compiling his party's report .</S>
<S>Since it began work in April the commission has been hearing harrowing tales from the victims of apartheid-era abuses , by both the white minority regime and its opponents .</S>
<S>It also wants to hear from those who committed the abuses , to whom it can offer amnesty in return for frankness .</S>
<S>Hopes that reformed perpetrators would come forward voluntarily have faded but the commission has the legal power to force them to appear .</S>
<S><PERSON>Allen</PERSON> declined to give say who would be subpoenaed .</S>
<S>" At the moment we have a preliminary list of less than 10 people , but this is just the beginning , " he said .</S>

<S><LOCATION>FORT WORTH</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> 1996-08-28</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Arch Petroleum Inc</ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday an exploratory well in <LOCATION>Alberta</LOCATION>'s <LOCATION>Morinville</LOCATION> area tested in excess of 1,100 barrels daily and will begin production immediately .</S>
<S>The company said the 90 percent owned Trax et al Morinville 10-23 logged 28 feet of productive <LOCATION>Leduc Reef</LOCATION> at 5,350 feet .</S>
<S>Reserve estimates from this well are at 250,000 gross barrels of oil .</S>
<S>The <LOCATION>Trax</LOCATION> well is one of the prospects developed by <ORGANIZATION>Arch</ORGANIZATION> through its early 1996 purchase of <ORGANIZATION>Trax Petroleums Ltd</ORGANIZATION> , the company said .</S>
<S>It said another , the Cometra et al Morinville 11-13 , has logged 128 feet of productive <LOCATION>Leduc Reef</LOCATION> at 5,400 feet and is flowing water free at the rate of 590 barrels of oil per day on a 15 / 64ths-inch choke .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Arch</ORGANIZATION> owns a 16 percent working interest in this well with most of the rest held by the privately owned operator .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Arch</ORGANIZATION> said full production has begun and initial estimates of gross reserves attributable to this well range up to one million barrels of oil .</S>
<S>A third well drilled in this area , the Trax et al Morinville 2-25 , encountered the <LOCATION>Leduc Reef</LOCATION> but tested wet .</S>
<S>At the company's Nordegg prospect , the Apache et al Saunders 14-28 , has reached total depth in the <LOCATION>Leduc Reef</LOCATION> at approximately 3,800 feet and has been abandoned , <ORGANIZATION>Arch</ORGANIZATION> said .</S>
<S>It said this acreage earning well brought an interest in an additional 5,120 acres , building the company's gross land position in this area to 8,320 acres .</S>
<S>At the Butte prospect , the Garrington 4-8 has reached total depth of 11,500 and has logged 278 feet of <LOCATION>Leduc Reef</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>Testing has begun and results will be announced within the next several days , <ORGANIZATION>Arch</ORGANIZATION> said .</S>
<S>Including the costs of the two abandoned wells , the company said , these first prospects have added to reserves at a finding cost of about <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> $ 2 per barrel of oil equivalent .</S>

<S><PERSON>Leslie Gevirtz</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>BOSTON</LOCATION> 1996-08-28</S>
<S>In order to help him decide whether he should hear the case , a <ORGANIZATION>U.S. District Court</ORGANIZATION> judge Wednesday ordered the legal counsels of <ORGANIZATION>Biogen Inc</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>Berlex Laboratories</ORGANIZATION> , a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION>Schering AG</ORGANIZATION> , deposed .</S>
<S>The tempest beyond the test tube involves allegations that the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Food and Drug Administration</ORGANIZATION> violated the Orphan Drug law by allowing <ORGANIZATION>Biogen</ORGANIZATION> the right to sell its multiple sclerosis drug Avonex .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Berlex</ORGANIZATION> also charges that Avonex is so similar to its MS drug , Betaseron , that it is a patent infringement .</S>
<S>Both drugs are types of interferon .</S>
<S>One analyst said sales of Avonex had already cut into Betaseron market share .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>BioVest Research , Inc</ORGANIZATION>'s analyst <PERSON>Eddie Hedaya</PERSON> said , " <ORGANIZATION>Berlex</ORGANIZATION> sales are losing share like mad ...</S>
<S>my understanding of the marketplace is that they're below expectations . "</S>
<S>He added <ORGANIZATION>Chiron Corp</ORGANIZATION> reported its sales of inventory to <ORGANIZATION>Berlex</ORGANIZATION> was down .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Chiron</ORGANIZATION> makes Betaseron ; <ORGANIZATION>Berlex</ORGANIZATION> markets it , he said .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Biogen</ORGANIZATION> , in its <ORGANIZATION>Securities and Exchange Commission</ORGANIZATION> quarterly report for the period ending June 30 , said it had earned $ 6.1 million from Avonex sales during the drugs first six weeks on the market .</S>
<S>When it approved Avonex in May , the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> said both <ORGANIZATION>Biogen</ORGANIZATION>'s product and Betaseron were developed under the incentives of the Ophran Drug Act which provides seven years of marketing exclusivity for products that treat rare diseases .</S>
<S>Avonex " has been allowed to enter the market because it differs from interferon beta-1b ( Betaseron ) ..</S>
<S>the <ORGANIZATION>FDA</ORGANIZATION> said .</S>
<S>Now , <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON>Mark Wolf</PERSON> has ordered the chief counsel for <ORGANIZATION>Biogen</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Michael Astrue</PERSON> , and <PERSON>Robert Chabora</PERSON> , his counterpart at <ORGANIZATION>Berlex</ORGANIZATION> be deposed about a May 21 meeting the two men attended to help him determine whether the lawsuit filed by <ORGANIZATION>Biogen</ORGANIZATION> against <ORGANIZATION>Berlex</ORGANIZATION> should be heard in <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Berlex</ORGANIZATION> filed a lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION>Biogen</ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION>U.S. District Court</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Newark</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>N.J.</LOCATION> in July , but <ORGANIZATION>Biogen</ORGANIZATION> had already filed a suit against <ORGANIZATION>Berlex</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Massachusetts</LOCATION> in May .</S>

<S><PERSON>Marc Dutroux</PERSON> , the chief accused in a Belgian child murder and sex abuse scandal , is suspected of murdering a young Slovak woman , the Slovak office of <ORGANIZATION>Interpol</ORGANIZATION> said on Wednesday .</S>
<S><PERSON>Rudolf Gajdos</PERSON> , head of Slovak <ORGANIZATION>Interpol</ORGANIZATION> , told a news conference <PERSON>Dutroux</PERSON> was also believed to have planned the kidnapping of at least one Slovak woman .</S>
<S>" One of the police versions in the case of the murder of young gypsy woman in <LOCATION>Topolcany</LOCATION> , western <LOCATION>Slovakia</LOCATION> , this July , is a suspicion that <PERSON>Mark Dutroux</PERSON> could have been involved in the murder , " <PERSON>Gajdos</PERSON> said without elaborating on the age of the victim and on the other versions .</S>
<S>Slovak police , <ORGANIZATION>Interpol</ORGANIZATION> , and Belgian police have been following leads on <PERSON>Dutroux</PERSON>'s activities in <LOCATION>Slovakia</LOCATION> and the neighbouring <LOCATION>Czech Republic</LOCATION> where he is known to have made frequent visits .</S>
<S><PERSON>Gajdos</PERSON> said the police sketch of the suspected murderer was " 60 percent identical with <PERSON>Dutroux</PERSON>'s portrait " , and that <PERSON>Dutroux</PERSON> was known to have been in <LOCATION>Topolcany</LOCATION> around the time of the woman's murder .</S>

<S>" The Belgian police also informed us that <PERSON>Dutroux</PERSON> , together with one other man , had ( also ) planned the kidnapping of at least one Slovak woman , " <PERSON>Gajdos</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>" The plan apparently failed due to difficulties in crossing the border , " he added , but did not elaborate .</S>
<S>The Slovak police are also investigating visits by about 10 Slovak women , aged 17 to 22 , to <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> , at the invitation of <PERSON>Dutroux</PERSON> .</S>
<S>The women said they went to <LOCATION>Belgium</LOCATION> voluntarily and police suspect they were used to act in pornographic films , <PERSON>Gajdos</PERSON> said earlier this week .</S>

<S>Exiled Bosnians protest confusing voting rules .</S>
<S><PERSON>Duncan Shiels</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>NAGYATAD</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> 1996-08-28</S>
<S>Bosnian refugees in <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> , the first to vote last weekend in their country's first post-war election , found the rules confusing and some had no idea who they voted for , refugees and officials said on Wednesday .</S>
<S>" For the most part they really didn't understand what was going on , " the director of the <LOCATION>Nagyatad</LOCATION> camp <PERSON>Lajos Horvath</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday .</S>
<S>" It was confusing , they had no experience of voting , many of the refugees are only semi-literate and none of them knew anything about the candidates , " he said .</S>
<S>" They just voted along ethnic lines where they could . "</S>
<S>The Bosnian election is set for September 14 and voting began on Wednesday for most of the 600,000 Bosnians living abroad .</S>
<S>The <ORGANIZATION>Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe</ORGANIZATION> , which is running the election , allowed the ballot to be held on Sunday in four Hungarian refugee camps .</S>
<S>Some Moslem refugees among the 385 registered voters <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION>'s largest camp <LOCATION>Nagyatad</LOCATION> have written to the <ORGANIZATION>OSCE</ORGANIZATION> complaining that they were unable to vote in contests for the president or assembly of the <LOCATION>Bosnian-Croat Federation</LOCATION> , where most Moslems live .</S>
<S>This was because their pre-war homes are now in the Serb-controlled territory , so they were voting for the national assembly of the <LOCATION>Republika Srbska</LOCATION> , most of the candidates for which are Serbs .</S>
<S>For the foreign powers which back last year's <LOCATION>Dayton</LOCATION> peace agreement , the main point of the election rules is that by voting as though they were still in their pre-war homes , Bosnians should override the effects of ethnic cleansing and reassert the concept of a single multi-ethnic state .</S>
<S>But <PERSON>Adem Hodzic</PERSON> , one of the refugees who signed the letter of complaint , told <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION> :</S>
<S>" We only realised after voting that we were being denied the rights of other Bosnian Moslems to choose our president .</S>
<S>This vote seals the division of my country . "</S>
<S>Under the election rules citizens vote for a three-man presidency and <ORGANIZATION>House of Representatives</ORGANIZATION> for all <LOCATION>Bosnia-Hercegovina</LOCATION> and for assemblies and cantonal seats in either the <LOCATION>Moslem-Croat Federation</LOCATION> or the <LOCATION>Republika Srbska</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>On Sunday voters in <LOCATION>Hungary</LOCATION> also cast ballots for municipal councils but these will be invalidated following the cancellation of local elections by the <ORGANIZATION>OSCE</ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday .</S>
<S><PERSON>Husein Micijevic</PERSON> , who also signed the letter , alleged that elderly voters were directed who to vote for by Hungarian translators who stood in the polling booth to help them .</S>
<S>" Probably 100 refugees were shown where to put their cross , " he said .</S>
<S>Seventy eight-year-old <PERSON>Mandolina Zelic</PERSON> , a Bosnian Croat who has spent the last five years in <LOCATION>Nagyatad</LOCATION> , told <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION> she had cast her ballot because she'd been told to by the camp authorities but had no idea who she voted for .</S>
<S>" At first the organisers wouldn't let anyone help me but when they saw I didn't understand a young translator ringed the names I had to mark , " she said . "</S>
<S>I don't know who I voted for . "</S>
<S><PERSON>Maria Szabo</PERSON> of the Hungarian office organising the elections on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION>OSCE</ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday her office was studying the letter but said they had followed <ORGANIZATION>OSCE</ORGANIZATION> instructions very carefully .</S>
<S>" The envelopes , each with the five different voting slips , were sealed until voting and had written instructions on how to vote , " she said . "</S>
<S>But of course those who could not read had to be shown . "</S>

<S><PERSON>Lebed</PERSON> likely to fail on <LOCATION>Chechnya</LOCATION> - Polish minister .</S>
<S><LOCATION>WARSAW</LOCATION> 1996-08-28</S>
<S>Russian security chief <PERSON>Aleksander Lebed</PERSON> faces an almost impossible task in <LOCATION>Chechnya</LOCATION> and is likely to be sidelined , Polish Foreign Minister <PERSON>Dariusz Rosati</PERSON> was reported as saying on Wednesday .</S>
<S>According to best-selling daily <ORGANIZATION>Gazeta Wyborcza</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Rosati</PERSON> told the Polish parliament's foreign affairs committee on Tuesday that the fact <PERSON>Lebed</PERSON> had been charged with resolving the conflict in <LOCATION>Chechnya</LOCATION> showed he would be marginalised .</S>
<S>" It is almost impossible to gain success in this , " it quoted <PERSON>Rosati</PERSON> as saying during a committee debate .</S>
<S>" <PERSON>Lebed</PERSON> has no diplomatic experience .</S>
<S><PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> sent him there to compromise him .</S>
<S>This tactical manoeuvre also shows that in the ruling circle there is no unity of action , " he said .</S>
<S><PERSON>Lebed</PERSON> , who has arranged a military truce with separatist rebels in the southern <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> region , was in <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION> this week seeking support for a deal on <LOCATION>Chechnya</LOCATION>'s political status .</S>
<S>But Russian President <PERSON>Boris Yeltsin</PERSON> has seemed unwilling to meet his envoy and went on holiday on Monday .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Gazeta Wyborcza</ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON>Rosati</PERSON> as saying <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> was very ill and effectively on leave , but for now retained control in <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> although matters were passing into the hands of his close collaborators .</S>
<S><PERSON>Rosati</PERSON> said <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>'s July polls , in which <PERSON>Yeltsin</PERSON> won re-election , showed democracy had passed an important test and the Russian people had chosed the path of further reforms .</S>
<S>But he said a power struggle in <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>'s ruling circles could not be ruled out , which could harm further reforms .</S>
<S>He expressed concern over problems in the Russian economy , saying this could lead to social unrest , the daily reported .</S>
<S>On <LOCATION>Moscow</LOCATION>'s foreign policy , <PERSON>Rosati</PERSON> said it had changed its stance on <ORGANIZATION>NATO</ORGANIZATION>'s eastward expansion and was preparing itself for <LOCATION>Poland</LOCATION>'s inevitable entry into the Western alliance .</S>
<S>He also reportedly criticised Russian Foreign Minister <PERSON>Yevgeny Primakov</PERSON> , saying his style of work resembled that of the Soviet-era 1970s and 1980s .</S>

<S>Six-month expenditures stood at 9.50 trillion lei , up from 7.56 trillion lei at end-May , with education and health spending accounting for 31.6 percent of state expenses and economic subsidies and support taking some 26 percent .</S>
<S>January-June revenues went up to 8.26 trillion lei from 6.96 trillion lei in the first five months this year .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION>'s government is expected to revise the 1996 budget on Wednesday to bring it into line with higher inflation , new wage and pension indexations and costs of energy imports that have pushed up the state deficit .</S>

<S><LOCATION>SAN JOSE</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION> 1996-08-28</S>
<S>The Costa Rican government said on Wednesday that a Dutch couple abducted over the weekend from a tree farm in northern <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION> was kidnapped by former Nicaraguan guerrillas .</S>
<S>" Even though it's an act of common delinquency , the case could take a difficult turn because former Nicaraguan guerrillas are involved , " Security Minister <PERSON>Bernardo Arce</PERSON> told reporters .</S>
<S>Earlier this year , a German tourist and a Swiss tour guide were kidnapped from the same general area in northern <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION> near the Nicaraguan border .</S>
<S>They were held for 71 days before relatives paid a ransom to free them .</S>
<S>Two Nicaraguan former guerrillas have been arrested in the case .</S>
<S>Because of the apparent threat to foreigners in <LOCATION>Costa Rica</LOCATION> near the Nicaraguan border , <PERSON>Arce</PERSON> said the government has advised many to take additional security measures on their own .</S>
<S><PERSON>Hurte Sierd Zylstra</PERSON> and his wife , <PERSON>Jetsi Hendrika Coers</PERSON> , both 50 years old , were seized late on Saturday or early on Sunday from a teak tree plantation they manage by at least two heavily armed men who took the two off in their own car , leaving behind a ransom note demanding $ 1.5 million .</S>

<S>Gov't dodging extradition , Colombian official says .</S>
<S><LOCATION>BOGOTA</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> 1996-08-28</S>
<S>A top judicial official and critic of President <PERSON>Ernesto Samper</PERSON> accused the government of indifference on Wednesday over efforts to lift <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION>'s five-year-old ban on extradition .</S>
<S>" It would seem that the subject of extradition is unworthy of an opinion from the government , " Deputy Prosecutor-General <PERSON>Adolfo</PERSON> <LOCATION>Salamanca</LOCATION> said .</S>
<S>Constitutional reforms were proposed on Tuesday by two senators , one of them a member of <PERSON>Samper</PERSON>'s own <ORGANIZATION>Liberal Party</ORGANIZATION> , aimed at lifting the ban on extradition introduced in 1991 .</S>
<S><LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Ambassador <PERSON>Myles Frechette</PERSON> applauded the move , saying it could prompt the <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> administration to remove <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> from a list of outcast nations that have failed to cooperate in <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> counternarcotics efforts .</S>
<S><PERSON>Samper</PERSON> -- who weathered a year-old crisis stemming from charges he financed his 1994 election campaign with drug money -- appeared less than enthusiastic , however .</S>
<S>" Extradition is not on the government's legislative agenda , " he told reporters on Tuesday .</S>
<S>He added that he did not oppose the idea of opening a public debate over the issue .</S>
<S>But he fell far short of endorsing the idea of putting Colombian drug lords onto U.S.-bound flights to serve stiff penalities in American prisons .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Salamanca</LOCATION> , who spoke at a meeting on kidnapping in <LOCATION>Colombia</LOCATION> , has said in the past that there was ample evidence to prove that <PERSON>Samper</PERSON>'s campaign received millions of dollars in contributions from the country's top drug lords .</S>

<S>WHEAT--Rains boost <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> HRW planting prospects .</S>
<S><PERSON>Greg Frost</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>KANSAS CITY</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Mo</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>Above-normal summer rainfall in the <LOCATION>U.S. High Plains</LOCATION> has produced near-ideal conditions for planting the 1997 hard red winter wheat crop , analysts said Wednesday .</S>
<S>From central <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> north to <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> , rains throughout July and August have relieved most of the drought conditions that plagued the region earlier this year .</S>
<S>" Our moisture situation is excellent , especially for fall planting of winter wheat , " said <PERSON>Kim Anderson</PERSON> , extension wheat marketing economist at <ORGANIZATION>Oklahoma State University</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>The irony of the above-average summer rainfall was not lost on <LOCATION>High Plains</LOCATION> wheat producers , who only three months ago were caught in a drought so severe that old-timers likened conditions to the " Dust Bowl " days of the 1930s .</S>
<S>" It's definitely a turnabout from this past year , but you know last year we had pretty good moisture about this time of year , and then about October 1 it quit , " said <PERSON>Mark Hodges</PERSON> , executive director of the <ORGANIZATION>Oklahoma Wheat Commission</ORGANIZATION> . "</S>
<S>Hopefully that's not going to happen this year . "</S>
<S>According to figures released by the Oklahoma Climatological Survey , an average of 20.19 inches fell across the state between March 1 and August 26 , 1996 .</S>
<S>That's about 1/2 inch above the average for the same time period , according to <PERSON>Howard Johnson</PERSON> , associate state climatologist at the <ORGANIZATION>University of Oklahoma</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>He noted that the majority of that 20.19 inches had fallen since July .</S>
<S>As an example of just how dry it was , data showed that between October 1 , 1995 and March 1 , 1996 , the state received an average of only 4.6 inches of rainfall .</S>
<S>In northern <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> , the current rainfall situation was similar to most of <LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION> , said <PERSON>Rodney Mosier</PERSON> , executive assistant for the <ORGANIZATION>Texas Wheat Producers</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>" Up here in the <LOCATION>Texas Panhandle</LOCATION> , we've had some extremely beneficial rains that came through within the last several days and are really setting us up for ideal conditions for planting wheat , " <PERSON>Mosier</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>But he warned that the situation was not as ideal in central and southern <LOCATION>Texas</LOCATION> , where mositure levels were still short despite the rains brought by Hurricane Dolly last week .</S>
<S>In <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> , typically the number one <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> hard red winter wheat producer , topsoil moisture levels were rated mostly adequate during the week ended Sunday , according to the state's agricultural statistics service .</S>
<S>In its weekly report released Monday , the service said <LOCATION>Kansas</LOCATION> topsoil moisture was rated eight percent surplus , 77 percent adequate and 15 percent short to very short .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Oklahoma</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>Agricultural Statistics Service</ORGANIZATION> showed similar conditions , rating topsoil moisture levels as seven percent surplus , 81 percent adequate and 12 percent short to very short .</S>

<S><ORGANIZATION>First Union National Bank of Florida</ORGANIZATION> said on Wednesday it agreed to settle a class action law suit involving its collateral protection insurance ( CPI ) program .</S>
<S>To provide for the settlements , <ORGANIZATION>First Union</ORGANIZATION> has established a common fund of $ 4.7 million for cash refunds and $ 19.4 million in credit refunds for outstanding CPI balances .</S>
<S>The bank is a division of <ORGANIZATION>First Union Corp</ORGANIZATION> .</S>

<S><ORGANIZATION>First Union</ORGANIZATION> said it has discontinued CPI as an element of its motor vehicle or boat installment loan contracts .</S>
<S>As part of the settlement agreement , customers who had CPI placed on loans from January 1 , 1986 to September 31 , 1996 , will receive cash or credit refunds , the bank said .</S>

<S><LOCATION>Burundi</LOCATION> defends military regime to hostile <ORGANIZATION>UN</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S><PERSON>Evelyn Leopold</PERSON></S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>UNITED NATIONS</ORGANIZATION> 1996-08-28</S>
<S><LOCATION>Burundi</LOCATION>'s ambassador on Wednesday lashed out at economic sanctions imposed by African states and said any thought of an arms embargo would be a windfall for guerrillas fighting his army-run government .</S>
<S>In a lengthy debate on <LOCATION>Burundi</LOCATION> before the <ORGANIZATION>U.N. Security Council</ORGANIZATION> , Ambassador <PERSON>Nsanze Terence</PERSON> said the new military government took over to stabilise the country and wanted negotiations under former Tanzanian President <PERSON>Julius Nyrere</PERSON> .</S>
<S>Nearly every African member who spoke , as well as most <ORGANIZATION>Security Council</ORGANIZATION> members , however , were unsympathetic towards the government of President <PERSON>Pierre Buyoya</PERSON> , an army major put in power in a July coup by the Tutsi-run military , which is locked in a guerrilla war with the majority Hutus .</S>
<S>" These ( African ) brothers should have been the first to bind the wounds of <LOCATION>Burundi</LOCATION> , " <PERSON>Terence</PERSON> said of the economic embargo . "</S>
<S>Quite the contrary , <LOCATION>Burundi</LOCATION> has seen economic war declared against it by fellow African people ... a gratuitous immolation of the people of <LOCATION>Burundi</LOCATION> . "</S>
<S>He said his government had just asked <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> human rights monitors to increase their numbers in <LOCATION>Burundi</LOCATION> in an effort " to put an end to this vicious circle of violence . "</S>
<S>More than 150,000 people have been killed in violence between the minority Tutsis and the majority Hutus since 1993 .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Botswana</LOCATION>'s envoy , <PERSON>Mothusi Nkgowe</PERSON> , said coups should be relegated " to the dump heap of history " as there could be no justification for the overthrow of a legitimate government .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Chile</LOCATION> has proposed a resolution , still under discussion , that would impose an immediate arms embargo on <LOCATION>Burundi</LOCATION> and call for negotiations .</S>
<S>The draft suggests further sanctions against those who impede a political solution .</S>
<S>Among the council's five permanent members , <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> appeared to support most elements of the Chilean proposal , while <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> were cautious .</S>
<S><PERSON>Terence</PERSON> , a Tutsi , said any arms embargo would leave the army unable to defend itself against Hutu guerrillas and leave the population exposed to " armed terroritsts . "</S>
<S>But Chilean Ambassador <PERSON>Juan Somavia</PERSON> said : " Every weapon that reached <LOCATION>Burundi</LOCATION> is a weapon aimed mainly at killing an unarmed civilian .</S>
<S>We must not send a signal different from the African leaders themselves .</S>
<S>Inaction is becoming the worst possible course of action . "</S>
<S><LOCATION>Burundi</LOCATION>'s parliament has been suspended and political parties are banned but <PERSON>Terence</PERSON> told reporters <PERSON>Buyoya</PERSON> would reconvene a new type of national assembly in October .</S>
<S>The <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> said the coup leaders had taken no steps to restore democracy and indiscriminate killings continued .</S>
<S>Ambassador <PERSON>Karl Inderfurth</PERSON> said the new government should have " unconditional " negotiations with all parties inside and outside of the country .</S>
<S>He said <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> strongly supported the economic sanctions imposed already and if these did not work the council would consider " an arms embargo or targeted sanctions against faction leaders . "</S>
<S>But he said the international community had to be prepared for the worst and avoid a replay of the horrors in neighbouring <LOCATION>Rwanda</LOCATION> , where widespread genocide broke out against the Tutsis two years ago .</S>
<S>He again said the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> should draw up contingency plans for a rapid humanitarian intervention .</S>

<S>About 8,000 protesters marched through <LOCATION>Karachi</LOCATION> on Wednesday demanding the removal of Pakistani Prime Minister <PERSON>Benazir Bhutto</PERSON> , witnesses said .</S>
<S>" From here we will march to <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION> and by <PERSON>God</PERSON> we will not let <PERSON>Benazir</PERSON> and ( <PERSON>Bhutto</PERSON>'s husband <PERSON>Asif Ali</PERSON> ) <PERSON>Zardari</PERSON> escape justice , " <PERSON>Nawaz Sharif</PERSON> , leader of the main opposition <ORGANIZATION>Pakistan Muslim League</ORGANIZATION> told a rally organised by a 16-party alliance .</S>
<S><PERSON>Sharif</PERSON> accused <PERSON>Bhutto</PERSON> of corruption and nepotism , charges she has denied in the past .</S>
<S>Witnesses said protesters carrying colourful party flags walked for several miles , chanting anti-government slogans .</S>
<S>The event was part of an opposition campaign launched on August 14 , <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION>'s independence day .</S>
<S><PERSON>Sharif</PERSON> said similar rallies would be held in the <LOCATION>Balochistan</LOCATION> provincial capital <LOCATION>Quetta</LOCATION> and the <LOCATION>Punjab</LOCATION> provincial capital <LOCATION>Lahore</LOCATION> before an opposition march on the capital <LOCATION>Islamabad</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>" I promise the people of <LOCATION>Karachi</LOCATION> that those responsible for the extra-judicial killing of innocent youths would not be spared , " <PERSON>Sharif</PERSON> said .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Karachi</LOCATION>'s ethnic <ORGANIZATION>Mohajir National Movement</ORGANIZATION> ( <ORGANIZATION>MQM</ORGANIZATION> ) accuses the government of killing many of its militants in cold blood .</S>
<S>The government has denied the charge and blames the <ORGANIZATION>MQM</ORGANIZATION> for much of the violence that killed 2,000 people in the city last year .</S>
<S>Political observers said the turn-out was disappointing for a city of about 12 million people , possibly indicating that the <ORGANIZATION>MQM</ORGANIZATION> , although a member of the opposition alliance , had not mobilised its supporters for the event .</S>
<S>The turbulent southern port has been calmer this year , but police say more than 300 people have died in political unrest .</S>
<S>The <ORGANIZATION>MQM</ORGANIZATION> speaks for Urdu-speaking Moslems who migrated from <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> at <LOCATION>Partition</LOCATION> in 1947 and their descendants .</S>
<S><PERSON>Sharif</PERSON> , a former prime minister , is the main political rival of <PERSON>Bhutto</PERSON> , who defeated him in the October 1993 election .</S>

<S>" Until the government releases our boats from naval custody and Sri Lankan naval custody , and gives us assurance ( it will not revoke licences of boats ferrying refugees ) , we will not call off our strike , " <PERSON>Bose</PERSON> said .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>LTTE</ORGANIZATION> spokesmen could not immediately be reached for comment , but Sri Lankan fishermen denied that Indians were being coerced into carrying refugees across the <LOCATION>Palk Strait</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>" Indian fishermen come right up to <LOCATION>Pesalai</LOCATION> to fish , and when refugees request them to ferry them across , they readily oblige .</S>
<S>Only some take money , " Sri Lankan boatman <PERSON>Chinnathambi</PERSON> said .</S>
<S><PERSON>Arulanandam</PERSON> denied the fishermen charged the refugees for passage to <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and said it was unfair to penalise them for the refugees ' arrival .</S>
<S>" We have not gone to sea since August 19 , but refugees are arriving daily nevertheless .</S>
<S>How could we alone be held responsible for the influx ? "</S>
<S>he said .</S>
<S>An <ORGANIZATION>Indian Fisheries Department</ORGANIZATION> official said the government planned to urge fishermen not to cross the international boundary between <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Sri Lanka</LOCATION> , but admitted this would be hard to enforce because of <LOCATION>Sri Lanka</LOCATION>'s pomfret-rich waters .</S>

<S>Dow pushes <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> stocks to new record .</S>
<S><PERSON>Peter Griffiths</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>LONDON</LOCATION> 1996-08-28</S>
<S>A firm start on <LOCATION>Wall Street</LOCATION> helped push leading <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> shares to a new record high on Wednesday and German stocks closed floor trading up but the <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> bourse slipped sharply , hit by a weakening franc and fears of industrial unrest .</S>
<S>On the foreign exchange markets , a survey indicating weaker than expected Japanese business sentiment boosted the dollar in early trading but it failed to build on its gains against the yen and slipped lower against the mark in quiet afternoon trade .</S>
<S><LOCATION>London</LOCATION> shares , boosted by <LOCATION>Wall Street</LOCATION> , added to early gains with the blue chip FTSE 100 index hitting a new peak of 3921.8 before dropping back slightly .</S>
<S>One focus was <ORGANIZATION>British Airways</ORGANIZATION> , which rebounded after fears faded that the cancellation of " open skies " talks between the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Transportation Department</ORGANIZATION> and the British government may jeopardise its tie-up with <ORGANIZATION>American Airlines</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>The conclusion of an open skies agreement had been made a prerequisite of the proposed link-up by the <LOCATION>U.S</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>Better-than-expected British trade figures had little impact on equities .</S>
<S>The non-EU July trade deficit totalled 506 million sterling ( $ 788 million ) while June's world deficit was 1.12 billion pounds .</S>
<S>Forecasts were for deficits of 900 million sterling and 1.4 billion sterling .</S>
<S>German shares shed some gains on profit-taking but nonetheless ended the floor session higher buoyed by demand for chemical stocks and a stable dollar .</S>
<S>The 30-share DAX index closed at 2,563.16 points , up 4.32 .</S>
<S>However , French stocks extended opening losses to more than one percent in morning trading , falling through the 2000 point resistance level on the main CAC-40 index .</S>
<S>Dealers blamed a weakening franc and worries about the 1997 budget and possible autumn strikes</S>
<S><PERSON>Louis Viannet</PERSON> , leader of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s Communist-led <ORGANIZATION>CGT</ORGANIZATION> union , criticised government plans for spending cuts in the 1997 budget on Wednesday and warned of labour unrest as <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> gets back to work after the holidays .</S>
<S>Later in the day , helped by the firmer <LOCATION>Wall Street</LOCATION> opening , <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> climbed back to the 2000 level but still remained well into negative territory .</S>
<S>In foreign exchange the dollar was trading at around 108.40 yen in the European afternoon , up from its European close on Tuesday of 107.55 but off the day's highs .</S>
<S>It had been boosted overnight by the <ORGANIZATION>Bank of Japan</ORGANIZATION>'s quarterly corporate survey , or " tankan " , of major manufacturers -- an important gauge of business sentiment .</S>
<S>The unexpectedly weak figures convinced markets that Japanese interest rates would stay at rock-bottom levels -- weakening the yen .</S>
<S>The Japanese discount rate is currently at a record low of 0.5 percent .</S>
<S>The <ORGANIZATION>BOJ</ORGANIZATION> sought to put the best face on the data which defied economists ' predictions of improving sentiment and was the first decline in business sentiment in a year .</S>
<S>A <ORGANIZATION>BOJ</ORGANIZATION> spokesman said " the doors to the recovery have not been shut ...</S>
<S>the recovery is still continuing . "</S>
<S>These remarks gave the yen some backbone and the dollar failed to progress further .</S>
<S>" The dollar's gains were less than spectacular , suggesting that while it's likely to benefit from revised Japanese rate expectations , a breakout from the established trading range doesn't appear likely , " said currency economist <PERSON>Klaus Baader</PERSON> .</S>
<S>Dealers said shares were also affected by a slippage in bond prices due to lower than expected June industrial production , showing the economy was still faltering .</S>
<S>CURRENCIES AT 1500 GMT</S>
<S>The dollar was at 108.40 yen and 1.4765 marks compared with Tuesday's European close of 107.78 yen and 1.4779 marks</S>

<S><PERSON>Arafat</PERSON> says <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> declares war on Palestinians .</S>
<S><PERSON>Wafa Amr</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>RAMALLAH</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>West Bank</LOCATION> 1996-08-28</S>
<S>Palestinian President <PERSON>Yasser Arafat</PERSON> said on Wednesday that <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> had declared war on the Palestinians and called for the first general strike in the <LOCATION>West Bank</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Gaza</LOCATION> in two years .</S>
<S>" What happened concerning continuous violations and crimes from this new Israeli leadership means they are declaring a state of war against the Palestinian people , " <PERSON>Arafat</PERSON> told the Palestinian legislature .</S>
<S>Accusing Israeli Prime Minister <PERSON>Benjamin Netanyahu</PERSON> of stupidity , <PERSON>Arafat</PERSON> launched his strongest attack on the right-wing government since its election in May .</S>
<S>The tirade was sparked by <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION>'s announcement on Tuesday of plans to expand the Jewish settlement of <LOCATION>Kiryat Sefer</LOCATION> and its demolishing of a community centre in <LOCATION>Arab East Jerusalem</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>" <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> has started the war on <LOCATION>Jerusalem</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>They are idiots to have started the <LOCATION>Jerusalem</LOCATION> battle , " <PERSON>Arafat</PERSON> said in Arabic . "</S>
<S>There will be no Palestinian state without <LOCATION>Jerusalem</LOCATION> .</S>
<S><PERSON>Netanyahu</PERSON> should know he is stupid to have started this battle . "</S>
<S><PERSON>Arafat</PERSON> called for a general strike " for <LOCATION>Jerusalem</LOCATION> " on Thursday in all of the <LOCATION>West Bank</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Gaza Strip</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>There has not been a joint shutdown there since May 1994 when Israeli troops began withdrawing under an interim self-rule agreement signed in 1993 .</S>
<S>The strike will have little effect on the Israeli economy while hurting Palestinian merchants in <LOCATION>East Jerusalem</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Bethlehem</LOCATION> who cater to the tourist trade .</S>
<S>Some 25,000 Palestinian labourers are likely to stay away from their jobs , mainly in construction , in <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>But Palestinians , once the backbone of the building industry , have been largely replaced by labourers from <LOCATION>Romania</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>" On Friday , all Moslems , including Palestinians in <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> ...</S>
<S>will go to ( <LOCATION>Jerusalem</LOCATION>'s ) <LOCATION>Al-Aqsa</LOCATION> mosque and pray .</S>
<S>Jews and Christians who do not pray should accompany them and stand behind them , " <PERSON>Arafat</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>Officials in <PERSON>Netanyahu</PERSON>'s office were not immediately available for comment on <PERSON>Arafat</PERSON>'s remarks .</S>
<S>Israeli travel restrictions , imposed after bombings by Moslem militants in February and March , ban most of the two million Arabs in the <LOCATION>West Bank</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Gaza</LOCATION> from entering <LOCATION>Jerusalem</LOCATION> .</S>
<S><PERSON>Netanyahu</PERSON> , who opposes trading occupied land for peace , made <LOCATION>Jerusalem</LOCATION> a central issue in his election campaign , accusing <ORGANIZATION>Labour</ORGANIZATION> Prime Minister <PERSON>Shimon Peres</PERSON> of planning to hand control of the Arab eastern part of the city to the Palestinians .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> captured <LOCATION>East Jerusalem</LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION>Middle East</LOCATION> war and claims both halves of the city as its capital .</S>
<S>The <ORGANIZATION>PLO</ORGANIZATION> wants <LOCATION>East Jerusalem</LOCATION> as the capital of a future Palestinian state .</S>
<S>In his speech to the crowded legislature , <PERSON>Arafat</PERSON> signalled he was not abandoning diplomacy although " alarm bells are ringing " .</S>
<S>He unexpectedly broke off his address to take a telephone call from <LOCATION>U.S. Middle East</LOCATION> envoy <PERSON>Dennis Ross</PERSON> , who held talks in <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> on Tuesday with Israeli and Egyptian officials .</S>
<S>When <PERSON>Arafat</PERSON> returned to the podium , he said senior <ORGANIZATION>PLO</ORGANIZATION> negotiator <PERSON>Mahmoud Abbas</PERSON> , better known as <PERSON>Abu Mazen</PERSON> , and <PERSON>Netanyahu</PERSON> aide <PERSON>Dore Gold</PERSON> could meet on Thursday .</S>
<S>He quoted <PERSON>Ross</PERSON> as telling him : " The important thing is the Israelis are prepared to move . "</S>
<S><PERSON>Arafat</PERSON> said he replied : " is this like their previous promises ? "</S>
<S>" No , they have good intentions , " <PERSON>Arafat</PERSON> quoted <PERSON>Ross</PERSON> as saying .</S>
<S>Palestinians have been pressing <LOCATION>Israel</LOCATION> to carry out a long-delayed partial troop pullout from the flashpoint <LOCATION>West Bank</LOCATION> city of <LOCATION>Hebron</LOCATION> agreed by the previous <ORGANIZATION>Labour</ORGANIZATION> government .</S>
<S>The Israeli government is studying redeployment plans submitted by Defence Minister <PERSON>Yitzhak Mordechai</PERSON> which are likely to demand a wider than agreed army presence in <LOCATION>Hebron</LOCATION> .</S>

<S><LOCATION>US</LOCATION> investors mull appeal of <ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's</ORGANIZATION> decision .</S>
<S><PERSON>Patricia Vowinkel</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>NEW YORK</LOCATION> 1996-08-27</S>
<S><LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> investors in troubled <ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's of London</ORGANIZATION> were considering late on Tuesday whether to appeal a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> court decision in favour of <ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's</ORGANIZATION> and pledged to continue pursuing other legal actions .</S>
<S>A <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> appeals court on Tuesday gave <ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's</ORGANIZATION> a reprieve , throwing out an injunction that the insurance giant said could have led to its collapse .</S>
<S>A lower court issued the injunction on Friday and ordered <ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's</ORGANIZATION> to give investors , known as Names , more information before requiring them to decide whether to accept a settlement offer as part of a reorganisation plan .</S>
<S>" My prediction is that the Names will appeal , " said <PERSON>Kenneth Chiate</PERSON> , a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Name and a chief negotiator for the <ORGANIZATION>American Names Association</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>" At this point , it is a sufficiently important decision that I'm confident that they will appeal , " he said . "</S>
<S>But to say that they definitely will would be premature until we determine what the exact basis for the court's ruling is . "</S>
<S>Under the reorganisation plan , <ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's</ORGANIZATION> plans to reinsure its massive liabilities into a new company called <ORGANIZATION>Equitas</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>The arrangement calls for investors to make additional payments to fund <ORGANIZATION>Equitas</ORGANIZATION> but also provides them with 3.2 billion stg in compensation to help reduce their prior outstanding liabilities .</S>
<S>The Names had been scheduled to decide whether to accept or reject the offer by 1100 GMT Wednesday , but <ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's</ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON>David Rowland</PERSON> said on Tuesday the offer would be extended .</S>
<S>At least eight <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> states have still some form of litigation pending , said <PERSON>John Head</PERSON> , spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION>Association of Lloyd's</ORGANIZATION> State Chairmen , a group representing <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> Names .</S>
<S>" It goes without saying that we're rather disappointed , " <PERSON>Head</PERSON> said of the decision by the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Court of Appeals</ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION>Fourth Circuit</ORGANIZATION> , sitting in <LOCATION>Baltimore</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>But , he said , " we still have hope that somebody is going to see our point of view in this . "</S>
<S>The <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> attorney general told <ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's</ORGANIZATION> last week it was considering a new legal action against the British insurance market , based on allegations of consumer fraud .</S>
<S>" We have notified them of our concerns and asked them to give us a response , " said <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> attorney general <PERSON>Gale Norton</PERSON> .</S>
<S><PERSON>Norton</PERSON> said she was concerned that the <ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's</ORGANIZATION> agreement immunizes it from future litigation regarding <ORGANIZATION>Equitas</ORGANIZATION> and requires that all legal actions be heard outside of <LOCATION>Colorado</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>In addition , she said she was concerned the plan may not offer investors enough protection from additional , future liabilities .</S>
<S>Meanwhile , an appeal of a lawsuit filed by some 600 Names in <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> is still pending before the <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Court of Appeals</ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION>Ninth Circuit</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Chiate</PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION>American Names Association</ORGANIZATION> said .</S>
<S>That lawsuit , which seeks rescision and restitution , was dismissed in a <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> district court .</S>
<S>That case " is what I call the most significant alternate remedy for us , " <PERSON>Chiate</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>The individual Names , however , now must decide whether to accept <ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's</ORGANIZATION> settlement offer or reject the offer and pursue litigation .</S>
<S><PERSON>Chiate</PERSON> said he has advised Names that " they must make , individually , a risk benefit analysis . "</S>
<S>Rejection involved forfeiting the compensation offer and risking the possibility of owing <ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's</ORGANIZATION> two to three times more than <ORGANIZATION>Lloyd's</ORGANIZATION> is now willing to accept , he said .</S>
<S>But , in rejecting the offer , the Names would retain their rights to pursue litigation , he said .</S>

<S>German prosecutors file sex tourism charges .</S>
<S><LOCATION>BERLIN</LOCATION> 1996-08-28</S>
<S><LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> prosecutors said on Wednesday they had filed charges against two German men for sexually abusing children in <LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION> and distributing pornographic films and pictures of their degrading acts .</S>
<S>The case is one of only a handful in which authorities have managed to track down suspects under a law which lets them pursue Germans who commit sex offences abroad .</S>
<S>The pair , identified only as 43-year-old clerk <PERSON>Dieter U</PERSON> and businessman <PERSON>Thomas S</PERSON> , 33 , are alleged to have carried out acts of sexual indecency with children as young as 10 years old between 1994 and 1995 .</S>
<S>Their videos included pictures of one of the accused tying up a Thai boy and performing acts of sadistic torture on him , prosecutors said in a statement .</S>
<S>In another scene , a young girl performed oral sex with an unidentified adult man .</S>
<S>The new law was introduced with much fanfare in 1993 .</S>
<S>But prosecutors face huge difficulties in gathering evidence and bringing witnesses to testify in a German court , and only one person has so far been convicted under the law .</S>
<S>Investigators are probing several other cases .</S>
<S>The <LOCATION>Berlin</LOCATION> prosecutors said they had been alerted to the two men by customs officials who intercepted packages containing pornographic photographs and order forms .</S>

<S>The <ORGANIZATION>BOJ</ORGANIZATION> released the August tankan , its quarterly short-term corporate survey , in the morning and it showed business outlook had worsened .</S>

<S>The <ORGANIZATION>Sakigake</ORGANIZATION> row has caused jitters in its coalition partners , Prime Minister <PERSON>Ryutaro Hashimoto</PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION>Liberal Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> ( <ORGANIZATION>LDP</ORGANIZATION> ) , the biggest grouping , and the <ORGANIZATION>Social Democratic Party</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>But analysts said the row was not expected to immediately destabilise the government as even if <ORGANIZATION>Sakigake</ORGANIZATION> splits apart it has so few seats a loss of support would not lead to a general election .</S>
<S>The dispute pits <PERSON>Takemura</PERSON> , who founded <ORGANIZATION>Sakigake</ORGANIZATION> in 1993 as a reform-oriented <ORGANIZATION>LDP</ORGANIZATION> splinter group , against party official <PERSON>Yukio Hatoyama</PERSON> , who says he will leave <ORGANIZATION>Sakigake</ORGANIZATION> to form a reformist political group next month .</S>
<S><PERSON>Hatoyama</PERSON> , the 49-year-old grandson of a 1950s prime minister , on Tuesday quit as <ORGANIZATION>Sakigake</ORGANIZATION> secretary general and has publicly snubbed the 62-year-old <PERSON>Takemura</PERSON> , pointedly ruling his mentor out as a possible member of the new political force .</S>
<S>Marathon talks between the two former allies on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning failed to resolve the dispute over the role of <PERSON>Takemura</PERSON> , seen by <PERSON>Hatoyama</PERSON> backers as tainted by his senior role in the LDP-dominated coalition .</S>
<S>The presence of <PERSON>Takemura</PERSON> , whose role as finance minister in passing an unpopular plan to use taxpayer funds to wind up failed housing loan firms ruined his reputation as a reformer , has stalled <PERSON>Hatoyama</PERSON>'s efforts to attract to his new group defectors from the opposition camp , analysts said .</S>
<S>Media reports say that at most 10 of 23 <ORGANIZATION>Sakigake</ORGANIZATION> members , joined by a handful of Social Democrats , will follow <PERSON>Hatoyama</PERSON> when he bolts -- far short of the 50 lawmakers needed to topple <PERSON>Hashimoto</PERSON>'s eight-month-old government .</S>
<S><PERSON>Hashimoto</PERSON> -- who returns from a 10-day Latin American tour on Saturday -- must call polls by mid-1997 , and has repeatedly said he would not call an early general election .</S>
<S>But many analysts and politicians believe he may dissolve parliament soon after it reconvenes in early October .</S>

<S><ORGANIZATION>UNITED NATIONS</ORGANIZATION> 1996-08-28</S>
<S><LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> has balked at the number of <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> staff needed to implement the oil-for-food deal , blaming the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> for insisting on stringent monitoring .</S>
<S>In comments to reporters and a statement on Tuesday , Iraqi diplomats said the cost of the monitors and other staff , which <LOCATION>Baghdad</LOCATION> has to finance , surpasses funds allocated for electricity , water , sewers , education and agriculture .</S>
<S>At issue was a May 20 agreement allowing <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> to sell $ 2 billion worth of oil to purchase badly needed food , medicine and other supplies to ease the impact of sanctions in force since its troops invaded <LOCATION>Kuwait</LOCATION> in August 1990 .</S>
<S>The Iraqi statement said the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> was " interfering and pressing to augment the number of international staff and this is not legal and not justified . "</S>
<S><LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION>'s deputy ambassador , <PERSON>Saeed Hasan</PERSON> , noted that the May 20 accord said that the number of personnel would be determined by the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> and that the government of <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> would be consulted .</S>
<S><PERSON>Saeed</PERSON> in his comments did not threaten to call off the deal and the <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> officials said they expected it to go into force next month after Secretary-General <PERSON>Boutros Boutros-Ghali</PERSON> reports that arrangements are in place .</S>
<S>The <ORGANIZATION>U.N. Department of Humanitarian Affairs</ORGANIZATION> ( <ORGANIZATION>DHA</ORGANIZATION> ) , which has to coordinate the distribution of food , medicine and other goods , increased the number of monitors earlier this month at the insistence of the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>According to <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> officials and diplomats , <LOCATION>Iraq</LOCATION> would have about $ 1.13 billion to spend for food , medicine and other goods after monies for a reparations fund for Gulf War victims and costs for <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> weapons inspections were deducted .</S>
<S>The cost of the <ORGANIZATION>U.N.</ORGANIZATION> staff overseeing the distribution of food and other supplies was estimated to cost $ 31 million .</S>
<S>In addition another $ 12 million was anticipated to cover other expenses , such as oil experts and administrative costs .</S>
<S>For the distribution and supervision of humanitarian supplies the <ORGANIZATION>United Nations</ORGANIZATION> estimated it needed 1,190 people , including 267 international staff and 923 Iraqi support staff .</S>
<S>Of this number 64 foreign and 598 local staff would be in the northern Kurdish provinces , no longer the direct control of the <LOCATION>Baghdad</LOCATION> government .</S>
<S>Another 203 international staff and 325 Iraqis would run the programme in the central and southern parts of the country .</S>
<S>There are also 14 monitors to watch oil flows , 32 customs experts and four New York-based oil experts or overseers to approve contracts .</S>
<S><PERSON>Yasushi Akashi</PERSON> , the <ORGANIZATION>DHA</ORGANIZATION> undersecretary-general , told the <ORGANIZATION>Security Council</ORGANIZATION> last week that the " financial requirements to support the ( humanitarian ) programme represent a very modest percentile of the total ...</S>

<S><ORGANIZATION>EU Commission</ORGANIZATION> cool on changing beef cull plan .</S>
<S><LOCATION>BRUSSELS</LOCATION> 1996-08-29</S>
<S>The <ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION> said on Thursday it would study scientific reports saying <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s mad cow epidemic would die out by 2001 but offered little prospect the findings would change an agreed slaughter campaign .</S>
<S>" Obviously we are interested in this research .</S>
<S>We will ask the ( <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> ) scientific and veterinary committee to examine it , " <ORGANIZATION>Commission</ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON>Gerard Kiely</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>Reuters</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>But he added that new research into the dynamics of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( BSE ) , a fatal brain-wasting disease suffered by cattle , was unlikely to alter a slaughter plan agreed by <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and its 14 <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> partners .</S>
<S>" We agreed that following detailed scientific analysis using a methodology which would take out the maximum number of BSE cases possible .</S>
<S>I think it would be very difficult to sell to the <ORGANIZATION>European Commission</ORGANIZATION> a programme which would involve the elimination of fewer BSE cases , " <PERSON>Kiely</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>" We will look at our approach ( to the plan ) but we won't get involved with the number of animals to be slaughtered , " he said .</S>
<S>" We have always avoided the question of numbers of animals to be slaughtered , that's not the issue .</S>
<S>The issue is the protection of consumers ' health and the rapid eradication of BSE , " he added .</S>
<S>The reaction is likely to disappoint British farmers , who seized on research by <ORGANIZATION>Oxford</ORGANIZATION> scientists in the scientific journal <ORGANIZATION>Nature</ORGANIZATION> saying it would be hard to get rid of the disease any faster than 2001 without killing vast numbers of cattle .</S>
<S>The researchers predicted there would be 340 new infections and 14,000 new cases of BSE before 2001 .</S>
<S>British farmers ' leader called on Wednesday for an urgent meeting with ministers to discuss the report .</S>
<S>" I hope the government will now make it clear they believe there is a better way of dealing with this issue , " <ORGANIZATION>National Farmers Union</ORGANIZATION> president Sir <PERSON>David Naish</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>BBC radio</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S><PERSON>Naish</PERSON> said there was no need for <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> to carry out a planned cull of some 147,000 cattle to which it had reluctantly agreed to placate its European partners .</S>
<S>" The new evidence to me means some of that proposal should be re-examined because we could get away with considerably less animals being culled if in fact scientists throughout <LOCATION>Europe</LOCATION> accepted this evidence , " <PERSON>Naish</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>The report could well reopen a damaging row between <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION>EU</ORGANIZATION> , which slapped a worldwide ban on British beef after the government said there could be a link between BSE and the human form of the disease .</S>
<S>The issue flared in in March when government scientists admitted that people could become infected with Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease ( CJD ) from eating BSE-infected beef .</S>

<S>By 3 a.m. ( 0100 GMT ) more than 2,000 lorries had been stopped and searched .</S>

<S><PERSON>Anwar</PERSON> , who struck a superb 176 at <LOCATION>The Oval</LOCATION> , was the more aggressive as he made 57 from 75 balls before skying a catch off <PERSON>Irani</PERSON> to <PERSON>Mullally</PERSON> at long-on .</S>

<S>TENNIS - <PERSON>MARTINEZ</PERSON> GETS AGGRESSIVE AT U.S. OPEN .</S>
<S><PERSON>Larry Fine</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>NEW YORK</LOCATION> 1996-08-28</S>
<S><PERSON>Conchita Martinez</PERSON> decided that when in <LOCATION>New York</LOCATION> , do as the New Yorkers do -- and the Spaniard's new-found aggressiveness seems to have put her in the right frame of mind for the U.S. Open .</S>
<S>The fourth-seeded Spaniard , who is tackling the world class traffic of <LOCATION>New York City</LOCATION> as a warm-up by driving to the tennis centre for her matches , ran over <LOCATION>France</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Nathalie Tauziat</PERSON> 6-1 6-3 on Wednesday to take her place in the third round .</S>
<S>" I've been trying my whole career to be aggressive , " said the 24-year-old <PERSON>Martinez</PERSON> after crushing <PERSON>Tauziat</PERSON> in just over an hour .</S>
<S>" What I'm trying to do is be aggressive all the time , maybe go up to the net a few times like I did tonight .</S>
<S>That would really help . "</S>
<S><PERSON>Martinez</PERSON> , the 1994 Wimbledon champion , used to struggle at the Open , but has come to terms with the noise , crowds and chaos .</S>
<S>" There is a lot of things that can happen , " <PERSON>Martinez</PERSON> said about her early difficulties adjusting to tennis on the cement at <LOCATION>Flushing Meadows</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>" Like traffic .</S>
<S>We stay in <LOCATION>Manhattan</LOCATION> and it's a long way to come .</S>
<S>The crowds , they speak louder or they move .</S>
<S>That doesn't happen in other Grand Slams .</S>
<S>That's where the real champion wins .</S>
<S>You have to concentrate for these two weeks . "</S>
<S>It took <PERSON>Martinez</PERSON> four Opens to get as far as the quarters , and another four to match that .</S>
<S>Last year , <PERSON>Martinez</PERSON> , who finished 1995 ranked second in the world , reached the semifinals before bowing out to <PERSON>Monica Seles</PERSON> .</S>
<S>Now she feels she is in the swing of things .</S>
<S>" I have my own car now and that helps , " said <PERSON>Martinez</PERSON> .</S>
<S>" Sometimes the transportation they ( the tournament ) provide gets a little messed up .</S>
<S>This time it didn't happen .</S>
<S>I do the driving and I love it .</S>
<S>It gets my adrenalin going , those taxi drivers .</S>
<S>" We change lanes all the time in <LOCATION>Barcelona</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>I'm used to it and I like to drive fast . "</S>

<S>It was another stunning mid-season acquisition for the <ORGANIZATION>Braves</ORGANIZATION> , who already have an 11-game lead in the National League Eastern Division .</S>
<S>In the last 15 days , <LOCATION>Atlanta</LOCATION> has traded for third baseman <PERSON>Terry Pendleton</PERSON> , claimed outfielder <PERSON>Luis Polonia</PERSON> on waivers and called up minor-league phenom <PERSON>Andruw Jones</PERSON> , all in preparation for their fifth post-season .</S>

<S><LOCATION>BELGRADE</LOCATION> 1996-08-29</S>
<S><LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> envoy <PERSON>John Kornblum</PERSON> met Serbian President <PERSON>Slobodan Milosevic</PERSON> on Thursday in an effort to defuse a growing crisis surrounding <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION>'s post-war elections .</S>
<S>The American diplomat arrived in <LOCATION>Belgrade</LOCATION> two days after international organisers postponed municipal elections in <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION> due to irregularities in the registration of Serb refugee voters .</S>
<S>" We discussed the decision to postpone the municipal elections and I made clear it was primarily the manipulation of voter registration by the <LOCATION>Republika Srpska</LOCATION> ( Bosnian Serb republic ) which led to this development , " <PERSON>Kornblum</PERSON> said after three hours of talks .</S>
<S>But he said the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> still believed it was important to go ahead with national elections in <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION> as scheduled on September 14 to bolster the peace process .</S>
<S><PERSON>Kornblum</PERSON> gave no indication that he had won any specific commitment from <PERSON>Milosevic</PERSON> , the patron of the Bosnian Serbs , to rectify any abuses in the registration process .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION>'s Moslem political parties have urged their refugees to boycott the elections until irregularities with voter registration are resolved .</S>
<S>Human rights workers say Serbian and Bosnian Serb authorities coerced refugees to register only in Serb-held territory in <LOCATION>Bosnia</LOCATION> to solidify the results of wartime expulsions and military conquest .</S>
<S>Serbian officials have denied any abuses occurred during a 10-day registration period and the Bosnian Serbs , angry at the postponement of municipal elections , have threatened to hold local polls on their territory without the international community's blessing .</S>
<S><PERSON>Kornblum</PERSON> said only elections endorsed by the <ORGANIZATION>Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe</ORGANIZATION> ( <ORGANIZATION>OSCE</ORGANIZATION> ) would be legitimate .</S>
<S>" As we have said publicly before , if there is any effort to do so ( hold local elections ) these elections will not be valid , " he said . "</S>
<S>The elections which are valid are those conducted by the international community under the management of the <ORGANIZATION>OSCE</ORGANIZATION> . "</S>
<S>After meeting <PERSON>Milosevic</PERSON> , <PERSON>Kornblum</PERSON> flew to the Croatian capital <LOCATION>Zagreb</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>He was due to head to the Bosnian town of <LOCATION>Banja Luka</LOCATION> on Friday to meet Bosnian Serb acting president <PERSON>Biljana Plavsic</PERSON> and Bosnian Serb opposition leaders .</S>

<S>A stake of 10 million shares in Russian gas monopoly <ORGANIZATION>RAO Gazprom</ORGANIZATION> was sold at auction on Thursday at an average 2,901.48 roubles a share , up from 2,891.00 roubles a week ago , the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Securities Corporation</ORGANIZATION> ( <ORGANIZATION>FFK</ORGANIZATION> ) said .</S>
<S>Starting price at the auction was 2,746 roubles a share and the 40 lots sold for between 2,840 and 2,998 roubles a share , the <ORGANIZATION>FFK</ORGANIZATION> said in a statement .</S>
<S>The stake represented 0.042 percent of <ORGANIZATION>Gazprom</ORGANIZATION>'s capital .</S>
<S>The <ORGANIZATION>FFK</ORGANIZATION> said that since auctions began , 139.75 million shares , equivalent to 0.59 percent of <ORGANIZATION>Gazprom</ORGANIZATION> , have changed hands .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Gazprom</ORGANIZATION> , <LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>'s biggest company by market capitalisation , has massive reserves and potentially huge earnings .</S>
<S>However , its 23.6 billion shares are highly illiquid and management permission is required to sell them .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Gazprom</ORGANIZATION> has recently tightened these rules , making it harder for shareholders to sell to whoever they want , when they want .</S>
<S>The company has organised regular auctions of its shares to create an orderly market in the paper .</S>
<S>At the first auction on March 6 , shares sold for an average 406.6 roubles each , and prices have been rising steadily since then , but the rise in price this week and last was much less than in previous auctions .</S>
<S>On the Russian Trading System , <ORGANIZATION>Gazprom</ORGANIZATION> shares rose 25 percent on Thursday to $ 0.375 from $ 0.300 , after falling by over a third earlier this week .</S>

<S><LOCATION>Thailand</LOCATION>'s powerful military thinks the government is dishonest and Prime Minister <PERSON>Banharn Silpa-archa</PERSON>'s resignation might solve the nation's political and economic woes , an opinion poll showed on Thursday .</S>
<S>Nearly half the 1,617 military personnel surveyed in the <ORGANIZATION>Rajapat Institute</ORGANIZATION> poll suggested that <PERSON>Banharn</PERSON> resign , while about 28 percent thought he should dissolve parliament and 24 percent thought a cabinet reshuffle could resolve the government's problems .</S>

<S>Scandal hits <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> campaign at vital moment .</S>

<S><LOCATION>CHICAGO</LOCATION> 1996-08-29</S>
<S>President <PERSON>Bill Clinton</PERSON>'s triumphal appearance at the Democratic convention , a vital moment in his bid for a second term , was marred on Thursday by the resignation of a top adviser in a reported sex scandal .</S>
<S><PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> was at work on the nomination acceptance speech that will launch his 10-week re-election campaign when political strategist <PERSON>Dick Morris</PERSON> abruptly announced his resignation on Thursday .</S>
<S>The tabloid <ORGANIZATION>Star magazine</ORGANIZATION> reported the married <PERSON>Morris</PERSON> had a lengthy affair with a $ 200-an-hour prostitute who he allowed to eavesdrop on telephone conversations with <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> , and with whom he shared <LOCATION>White House</LOCATION> speeches before they were made .</S>
<S>" <PERSON>Dick Morris</PERSON> is my friend , and he is a superb political strategist , " <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> said in a written statement . "</S>
<S>I am and always will be grateful for the great contributions he has made to my campaigns and for the invaluable work he has done for me over the last two years . "</S>
<S><PERSON>Morris</PERSON> declined to address the allegations directly in his resignation statement but said he was quitting to avoid becoming a campaign issue .</S>
<S>The surprise development captivated the thousands of reporters at the convention and clearly worried some Democrats , who had planned a triumphal celebration of <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s lead over <PERSON>Dole</PERSON> in the opinion polls .</S>
<S>Senator <PERSON>Dianne Feinstein</PERSON> , a <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> Democrat , called it a " big bump " in the way of the <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> campaign .</S>
<S>" It comes at the worst possible time on one of the biggest days for the president , " <PERSON>Feinstein</PERSON> said .</S>
<S><PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> was to deliver his acceptance speech at the final session of the Democratic Convention opening at 8 p.m. EDT ( midnight GMT ) .</S>
<S>The 50-year-old president has been dogged for years by allegations of financial wrongdoing , sexual misconduct and questionable judgment in selecting his advisers .</S>
<S>Republicans hope to seize on the " character " issue to bolster <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s challenger <PERSON>Bob Dole</PERSON> in the final weeks of the campaign .</S>
<S>Speaking in <LOCATION>Santa Barbara</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Dole</PERSON> did not directly refer to the sexual scandal but said the departure of <PERSON>Morris</PERSON> , who had advised <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> to chart a more centrist political course , would make <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> drift back to the left .</S>
<S>" <PERSON>Morris</PERSON> has been trying to make President <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> a Republican , now maybe he'll revert to the liberal Democrat that he really is , " <PERSON>Dole</PERSON> told reporters .</S>
<S><PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> will hit the road on Friday for a bus tour across several states in his fight to become the first Democratic incumbent re-elected to a second term since the days of <PERSON>Franklin D. Roosevelt</PERSON> .</S>
<S>Aides said <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> planned to spend most of Thursday in his hotel room several miles ( km ) from the convention hall working on his speech .</S>
<S>It was apparently neglected on his long " whistle-stop " train trip to the convention , during which he revelled in contact with friendly crowds across the country's heartland .</S>
<S>He was also hoarse and was giving his voice a rest .</S>
<S>But first lady <PERSON>Hillary Rodham Clinton</PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION>ABC</ORGANIZATION> television , " He's really fired up . "</S>
<S>" He wants to outline to the American people what he thinks has been accomplished in the last four years , and what he would like to see done in the next four years , " she said .</S>
<S>" He's very excited about this convention ...</S>
<S>He's excited about the campaign .</S>
<S>But more than that , he's very resolute about what he wants to do . "</S>
<S>" I don't take anything for granted .</S>
<S>I always expect elections to get close .</S>
<S>I expect to have a great deal of up and down days between now and then , " she said of the November 5 election date .</S>
<S><PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> is leading <PERSON>Dole</PERSON> by as much as 15 points according to some polls .</S>
<S>The campaign pits <PERSON>Dole</PERSON> , a man of quick and withering wit and long-time public service , but stilted speaking style , against the glib and confident <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> , who has perfected a style that makes direct eye contact with his audience .</S>

<S>Researchers report progress in muscular dystrophy .</S>
<S><LOCATION>PHILADELPHIA</LOCATION> 1996-08-29</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>University of Pennsylvania</ORGANIZATION> researchers on Thursday said a new gene-therapy technique for treating muscular dystrophy disease had shown progress in laboratory animals .</S>
<S>Word of the findings , to be published in the Oct. 1 issue of the journal " <ORGANIZATION>Human Gene Therapy</ORGANIZATION> , " came in advance of the annual Jerry Lewis Labour Day weekend telethon to raise money for muscular dystrophy research .</S>
<S>Several hurdles must be overcome before the method is used in human trials .</S>
<S>Nevertheless , " a treatment based on the new strategy .... may have the potential to benefit many patients , " the <ORGANIZATION>University of Pennsylvania</ORGANIZATION> Medical Centre said in a release .</S>
<S>Muscular dystrophy is a fatal illness in which the body's muscle tissue degenerates and is replaced by fat .</S>
<S>Death strikes in early adulthood .</S>
<S>Individuals with the disease have a non-working version of a gene responsible for producing a crucial muscle protein called dystrophin .</S>
<S>In the study at the University's <ORGANIZATION>Institute for Human Gene Therapy</ORGANIZATION> , researchers altered a common-cold virus to carry a version of the working dystrophin gene .</S>
<S>The virus , which also was altered to minimise its susceptibility to the immune system , was then injected into the muscle cells of mice bred to lack dystrophin genes .</S>
<S>In the experiment , between 30 to 40 percent of the muscle fibers in one group of mice produced dystrophin for two weeks before diminishing .</S>
<S>Similar results had been obtained previously in test-tube cell cultures , but not in live animals , the university said .</S>
<S>The university said methods are still needed to make enough of the altered virus to treat humans , to further decrease the immune-system response to the virus , and to deliver the virus to human muscle tissue .</S>

<S>Help-wanted ad index fell in July .</S>
<S><LOCATION>NEW YORK</LOCATION> 1996-08-29</S>
<S>The help-wanted advertising index fell in July , the <ORGANIZATION>Conference Board</ORGANIZATION> said Thursday , reflecting the uneven nature of the nation's labour markets .</S>
<S>The monthly index fell to 83.0 in July against a reading of 85.0 in June , the private business research group said .</S>
<S>In July , the volume of help-wanted advertising fell in five of the nine <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> regions .</S>
<S>" The labour market has been expanding throughout 1996 , but in a very uneven pattern , " <ORGANIZATION>Conference Board</ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON>Ken Goldstein</PERSON> said . "</S>
<S>Recent want-ad figures indicate that conservative hiring plans are keeping job growth below the rate of overall economic activity . "</S>
<S>With 2.5 percent gross domestic product growth expected for 1996 , new job growth should slowly lower the unemployment rate over the rest of the year .</S>
<S>" With the unemployment rate staying close to about 5.5 percent over the last two years , there is a good chance the rate will slowly drop to about 5.0 percent by the end of the year , " <PERSON>Goldstein</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>The July index matched the reading for July , 1995 .</S>
<S>The greatest declines in the volume of help-wanted advertising were in the <LOCATION>New England</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Mountain</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>West South Central</LOCATION> regions .</S>
<S>The greatest increase was in the <LOCATION>East North Central</LOCATION> region .</S>

<S><PERSON>O.J. Simpson</PERSON> hints at more supporting evidence .</S>
<S><PERSON>Jackie Frank</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>WASHINGTON</LOCATION> 1996-08-29</S>
<S><PERSON>O.J. Simpson</PERSON> said on Thursday he was financially broken by his defence against murder charges but he was hopeful new evidence to support him would be available for a civil trial next month .</S>
<S>The former football star was found not guilty by a criminal trial jury last October of the murders of his former wife , <PERSON>Nicole Brown Simpson</PERSON> , and her friend , <PERSON>Ronald Goldman</PERSON> , in June 1994 .</S>
<S>He now faces a civil suit brought by families of the victims who hold him responsible for the deaths .</S>
<S>He told reporters a court order not to talk about his case kept him from detailing how he has fulfilled his pledge to find the killers .</S>
<S>But he added without elaborating , " hopefully we will see some things come out in this next trial . "</S>
<S>The judge in the civil trial has imposed a sweeping gag order that prohibits lawyers , witnesses and parties to the case from discussing it with the media or elsewhere in public .</S>
<S>" I would love to speak about everything , " said <PERSON>Simpson</PERSON> , who vowed after his acquittal to find the killers and offered a substantial reward .</S>
<S>His lawyers have said his defence in the civil trial that starts Sept .</S>
<S>17 will be that he did not kill the victims .</S>
<S><PERSON>Simpson</PERSON> said at the hotel news conference his plans include eventually writing another book .</S>
<S>He added that he has had job offers but more have come from abroad than at home .</S>
<S>" I'm broke .</S>
<S>I am not crying the blues .</S>
<S>I can get along just fine , " he said . "</S>
<S>Whatever you want to send me , I need . "</S>
<S>He again accused the news media of erroneous reporting on his case but did not signal any plans for lawsuits as he did on Wednesday in an address at a jam-packed <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> church .</S>
<S>Contrary to news reports , <PERSON>Simpson</PERSON> said , he has received support from both blacks and whites .</S>
<S>He again dismissed charges that he had distanced himself from the black community during his successful football and commercial career , only to seek their support after he faced murder charges .</S>
<S>A crowd of 2,000 paid $ 10 a head to hear the former star running back for the <ORGANIZATION>Buffalo Bills</ORGANIZATION> professional football club and a Football Hall of Fame member on Wednesday night .</S>
<S>The crowd in the church was wildly supportive , showering <PERSON>Simpson</PERSON> with gifts and praise .</S>
<S>But outside , dozens of protesters from the <ORGANIZATION>D.C. Coalition Against Domestic Violence</ORGANIZATION> called for the church to support victims of violence instead .</S>

<S>Health officials said on Thursday they were investigating the discovery of an amputated foot on a beach near <LOCATION>Charleston</LOCATION> to determine whether a local surgeon had improperly disposed of infectious waste .</S>

<S><ORGANIZATION>SoCal Edison</ORGANIZATION> sees 2 power lines back today .</S>
<S><LOCATION>NEW YORK</LOCATION> 1996-08-29</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Southern California Edison Co</ORGANIZATION> said it expected two 220 kilovolt ( KV ) power lines in southern <LOCATION>California</LOCATION> to resume service later today after being shut late Wednesday because of a wildfire raging north of <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>" They are expected to be placed in service later today , " said company spokesman <PERSON>Steve Conroy</PERSON> , adding repair crews have been removing smoke and other fire-related residues , which had settled on the two lines .</S>
<S>The shutdown of the 220 KV lines reduced by 500 megawatts ( MW ) the amount of power which the area received from <ORGANIZATION>SoCal Edison</ORGANIZATION>'s 1,200 MW <LOCATION>Sierra</LOCATION> hydroelectric facility , he said .</S>
<S><PERSON>Conroy</PERSON> noted two 500 KV and another 220 KV line running from the <LOCATION>Sierra</LOCATION> plant to <LOCATION>Los Angeles</LOCATION> remained in operation , and continued to carry some of the production from <LOCATION>Sierra</LOCATION> to the region .</S>
<S>On Monday , the two 500 KV transmission cables were taken out of service , also for cleaning , for about a day .</S>
<S>Containment of the fire has been difficult because of the hot , arid , windy weather in the region , <PERSON>Conroy</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>" The fires keep moving back because of the winds , " he said , forcing the utility to shut those transmission lines for a second time this week .</S>
<S>Local authorities charged a teenager for starting the blaze .</S>
<S>In four days , the fire destroyed 20,000 acres of forest land .</S>

<S><ORGANIZATION>Sierra Semiconductor</ORGANIZATION> jumps on exit plan .</S>
<S><PERSON>Martin Wolk</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>SEATTLE</LOCATION> 1996-08-29</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Sierra Semiconductor Corp</ORGANIZATION> jumped 23 percent Thursday on the expectation the company would emerge as a smaller but more profitable operation after its planned exit from the computer modem business .</S>
<S>The <LOCATION>San Jose</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Calif.</LOCATION> , company was up 2-1/8 at 11-3/8 after its announcement Wednesday that it planned to pull out of the highly competitive modem-chip business and focus instead on the fast-growing market for computer networking equipment .</S>
<S>" Certainly the company will be a much smaller company now , but it will be a more profitable business , " said analyst <PERSON>Elias Moosa</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Roberston Stephens & Co</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>But analysts noted that <ORGANIZATION>Sierra</ORGANIZATION> still has much painful work ahead of it , including cutting as many as 150 jobs from its workforce , which currently has 500 people , and building up the business of its <ORGANIZATION>PMC-Sierra</ORGANIZATION> unit , which makes routing devices and chipsets for high-speed computer networks .</S>
<S>The company has announced plans to take a charge against earnings of $ 50 million to $ 80 million to write down the value of assets and inventories and cover severance payments .</S>
<S><PERSON>Scott Randall</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Soundview Financial Group</ORGANIZATION> said the company likely would have difficulty selling its modem-chip business .</S>
<S>" Once you announce your intention to exit a business , it becomes a complete buyer's market , " he said .</S>
<S>And he said that while the company is focusing on the fastest-growing part of its business , the market for networking chips has begun to attract the attention of much-larger players such as <ORGANIZATION>International Business Machines Corp</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>" As the market develops the question is , are they able to make that transition to be a much larger company ? "</S>
<S><PERSON>Randall</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>Other analysts were more bullish , even though the company is expected to shrink to slightly more than half its current size in sales .</S>
<S>" It's a positive strategic move , " said <PERSON>Miles Kan</PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION>Hambrecht & Quist</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>" The modem business is a low-margin , commodity business , " he said .</S>
<S>The company's <ORGANIZATION>PMC-Sierra</ORGANIZATION> unit generated $ 33 million of the company's $ 117 million in sales in the first half of the year , compared with $ 45 million in sales of modem chips , <PERSON>Kan</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>But the <ORGANIZATION>PMC</ORGANIZATION> unit is far more profitable , he said .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Sierra</ORGANIZATION>'s stock has fallen from a high of nearly $ 25 this year as the computer chip sector has been battered by falling prices and concern about slowing demand .</S>

<S>Iranian security forces have broken up five espionage rings in northwestern <LOCATION>Iran</LOCATION> and arrested 41 people on charges of spying for unnamed countries , a daily newspaper said on Thursday .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Jomhuri Eslami</ORGANIZATION> quoted the <LOCATION>West Azerbaijan</LOCATION> province security chief as saying those held confessed to gathering confidential information , photographing strategic sites , doing propaganda against state officials and " spreading pan-Turkism " .</S>

<S>The April arrests were announced shortly after a row in which <LOCATION>Tehran</LOCATION> asked <LOCATION>Ankara</LOCATION> to withdraw four Turkish diplomats accused of spying , and <LOCATION>Turkey</LOCATION> expelled four Iranian diplomats for their alleged links to killings of Iranian exiles .</S>

<S><LOCATION>DUBAI</LOCATION> 1996-08-29</S>
<S><LOCATION>India</LOCATION> will continue to hold the key to the middle distillates product market in the <LOCATION>Middle East Gulf</LOCATION> in the short term , traders in the region said on Thursday .</S>
<S>They said premiums on high quality jet kerosene have widened to around $ 1 , and are likely to remain strong in the near term .</S>
<S>" On the jet kerosene side we must be cautious about quality .</S>
<S>Some are commanding a very good premium of 95 cents to one dollar .</S>
<S>It's been 99 cents to <LOCATION>Korea</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>This will stay at this sort of price premium for a while , " one said .</S>
<S>" But for normal jet the weakened demand is quite noticeable , the premium is around 45-50 cents .</S>
<S>The differential is not normally as wide as this , " he added .</S>
<S>Another put the premium for jet kerosene at between 65 and 75 cents .</S>
<S>One trader said despite the fact that some kerosene was in storage at <LOCATION>Dubai</LOCATION> ports , demand looked to exceed supply in the near term .</S>
<S>Jet kerosene was assessed at $ 27.40 - $ 27.70 a barrel fob <LOCATION>Gulf</LOCATION> on Thursday , up from $ 27.22 last week .</S>
<S>Dealers expected premiums to stick around current levels for the next two or three weeks , before they get a boost in the second half of September from demand for October cargoes .</S>
<S>Gas oil , assessed at $ 24.00 - $ 24.20 a barrel fob <LOCATION>Gulf</LOCATION> , was little changed on Thursday from last week's $ 24.10 - $ 24.24 .</S>
<S>" On gas oil , in the near term demand and supply are balanced to a bit short , there are some enquiries into east <LOCATION>Africa</LOCATION> and short covering in <LOCATION>India</LOCATION> , " said one trader .</S>
<S>" The Indians have awarded three cargoes , but the question is whether they will come out for more , " he added .</S>
<S><LOCATION>India</LOCATION> has acquired 120,000 tonnes of diesel in three cargoes , bound for the west coast , in its October tender .</S>
<S>Traders said the award could be <LOCATION>India</LOCATION>'s lowest in recent years .</S>
<S>" After <ORGANIZATION>IOC</ORGANIZATION>'s very small purchase of 120,000 tonnes , I'm still suspicious that they will buy more in the second half of October , " another said .</S>
<S>But traders see the market remaining tight in the short-term , with some surplus arising closer to October .</S>
<S>" I see an overhang of gas oil further out , " one said .</S>
<S>" Gas oil will remain tight in the short term up to mid-September with the premium of around $ 1 for 0.5 percent ( sulphur material ) .</S>
<S>In the second half of September and October we see the premium coming off to 70-75 cents . "</S>
<S>Traders said there was not much demand for one percent sulphur material gas oil , with the premium at 40 to 45 cents .</S>

<S>FEATURE - Rich new detail on U.S. Civil War unearthed .</S>
<S><PERSON>Leila Corcoran</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>WASHINGTON</LOCATION> 1996-08-29</S>
<S>A freed black man writes to his still-enslaved wife , a mother pleads with <PERSON>Abraham Lincoln</PERSON> on behalf of her son and a maimed soldier poses for an official photograph in newly reopened records that bring the U.S. Civil War back to life .</S>
<S>Working in the basement of the <ORGANIZATION>National Archives</ORGANIZATION> , members of the <ORGANIZATION>Civil War Conservation Corps</ORGANIZATION> are organising the military records of volunteers who fought for the <LOCATION>North</LOCATION> so that they can be preserved on microfilm .</S>
<S>The faded documents have been stowed away in the <ORGANIZATION>Archives</ORGANIZATION> since it opened in 1935 and have rarely seen the light of day .</S>
<S>Each soldier's file is a gold mine of information : enlistment papers , muster rolls , medical records , discharge certificates , letters and photographs .</S>
<S>Since the project began almost two years ago , corps volunteers have focused on African American troops , preparing records in time for the unveiling in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> this year of a special memorial to black soldiers who fought in the war .</S>
<S>More than 185,000 black soldiers fought and 37,000 died .</S>
<S>In one letter , a black soldier heading <LOCATION>South</LOCATION> wrote his wife , " though great is the present national difficulties yet I look forward to a brighter day when I shall have the oportunity of seeing you in the full enjoyment of freedom .</S>
<S>" I would like to no ( sic ) if you are still in slavery if you are , it will not be long before we shall have crushed the system that now oppreses you for in the course of three months you shall have your liberty .</S>
<S>Great is the outpouring of the coloured people that is now rallying with the heart of lions against the very curse that has separated you and me . "</S>
<S>In another letter dated January 1865 , a well-to-do <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> matron wrote to <PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON> to plead for her son , who faced a dishonourable discharge from the <ORGANIZATION>Army</ORGANIZATION> . "</S>
<S><PERSON>James</PERSON> is a prisoner for a thoughtless act of folly , while those who have done nothing for the cause are free , " she wrote .</S>
<S><PERSON>Lincoln</PERSON>'s notation on the letter read : " If his colonel will say in writing on this sheet he is willing to receive this man back to the regiment , I will pardon and send him . "</S>
<S>The soldier was subsequently pardoned .</S>
<S>While the letters speak to the anguish of separation , a photograph of a black amputee speaks to the terrible physical cost of the war .</S>
<S>In a picture required for his military discharge , Pvt .</S>
<S><PERSON>Lewis Martin</PERSON> , with haunted eyes , posed bare-chested to reveal his missing arm and leg , blown off during a battle at <LOCATION>Petersburg</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Virginia</LOCATION> , in July 1864 .</S>
<S>The work on black troops has provided new insight into the rhythms of plantation talk and culture , said <PERSON>John Simon</PERSON> , professor of history at <ORGANIZATION>Southern Illinois University at Carbondale</ORGANIZATION> and editor of Gen .</S>
<S><PERSON>Ulysses Grant</PERSON>'s papers .</S>
<S>" These ( writings ) are not only poetic but a linguistic treasure trove .</S>
<S>This is the first generation of African Americans that really can express itself without fear and punishment , " <PERSON>Simon</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>" I think there's probably a whole lot of material that would expand our understanding of the sociology of the war , " said <PERSON>Edward Smith</PERSON> , director of <ORGANIZATION>American Studies</ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION>American University</ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION>Washington</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>The war between the <LOCATION>North</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>South</LOCATION> raged for nearly four years , claimed the lives of half a million Americans and forever seared the nation's consciousness .</S>
<S>Southern records have already been preserved .</S>
<S>They were put on microfilm about 30 years ago through a grant from the <ORGANIZATION>United Daughters of the Confederacy</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>The <ORGANIZATION>Civil War Conservation Corps</ORGANIZATION> is mostly retirees joined by students during the school year .</S>
<S>Director <PERSON>Budge Weidman</PERSON> , who has shepherded the project from the beginning , predicts it will take up to a decade to complete .</S>
<S>The work was inspired by a <ORGANIZATION>National Park Service</ORGANIZATION> plan to put computer databases at Civil War battlefields across the country so that Americans might research their ancestors .</S>
<S>The records also provide insight into medical thinking of the day .</S>
<S>One soldier was discharged because of " mental incapacity and inebetude ( sic ) of the brain , alleged by the Patient to be connected with a fall on the head but believed to arise from long continued and excessive masturbation . "</S>

<S>New bomb attacks on <LOCATION>Corsica</LOCATION> despite crackdown vow .</S>
<S><PERSON>Sylvie Florence</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>AJACCIO</LOCATION> , <LOCATION>Corsica</LOCATION> 1996-08-29</S>
<S>Separatist guerrillas planted two bombs overnight at government offices on the French Mediterranean island of <LOCATION>Corsica</LOCATION> despite fresh warnings of a crackdown by <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> , police said on Thursday .</S>
<S>In the latest in a wave of attacks , a two kg ( four lb ) bomb seriously damaged two floors of <ORGANIZATION>Agriculture Ministry</ORGANIZATION> offices located just 50 metres ( yards ) from a police station in the centre of the island capital <ORGANIZATION>Ajaccio</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>No one was hurt .</S>
<S>A second device , packed with five kg ( 10 lbs ) of explosive , was defused before it could go off , police said .</S>
<S>The new attacks followed by a day a warning of a new " get-tough " policy by <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> toward the separatists , who seek greater autonomy .</S>
<S>Interior Minister <PERSON>Jean-Louis Debre</PERSON> , under fire for staging secret talks with one of the largest of several rival underground nationalist groups , told the daily <ORGANIZATION>La Corse</ORGANIZATION> in a statement he had given " firm orders " to police to round up those responsible for the bombings and bring them to justice .</S>
<S>Judges on the island had accused <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> of taking a lax stance on guerrilla violence while conducting secret but widely-reported talks with separatists which have now failed .</S>
<S>The latest bombing , close on the heels of the new orders , brought charges that police were powerless .</S>
<S>" No searches , no arrests , no police reinforcements visible on the island , despite the ministry's promises , " the daily <ORGANIZATION>France-Soir</ORGANIZATION> lamented .</S>
<S>" On the island , as at the <LOCATION>Place Beauvau</LOCATION> ( the <ORGANIZATION>Interior Ministry</ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION>Paris</LOCATION> address ) , people are well aware who is who and who is doing what .</S>
<S>It is time to end this nightly farce , " said the pro-government daily <ORGANIZATION>Le Figaro</ORGANIZATION> in an editorial .</S>
<S>No one immediately claimed responsibility for Thursday's incidents , which brought to 23 the number of guerrilla attacks on the resort island since mid-August , when separatist guerrillas ended a shaky seven-month truce .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Corsica</LOCATION> has been racked by low-level separatist-inspired violence , principally directed against government targets , for two decades .</S>
<S>The daily <ORGANIZATION>Le Monde</ORGANIZATION> reported on Wednesday some separatist movements were considering taking their attacks to the French mainland on the principle that " 300 grammes of explosives on the continent have more impact than 300 kilos in <LOCATION>Corsica</LOCATION> " .</S>
<S>The newspaper said separatists may take advantage of social unrest widely expected on the mainland in coming weeks over government austerity plans to stoke a popular backlash against the government .</S>

<S><LOCATION>Sweden</LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION>OM</ORGANIZATION> to open <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> forest products bourse .</S>
<S><LOCATION>STOCKHOLM</LOCATION> 1996-08-29</S>
<S>Swedish options and derivatives exchange <ORGANIZATION>OM Gruppen AB</ORGANIZATION> said on Thursday it would open an electronic bourse for forest industry products in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> in the first half of 1997 .</S>
<S>" Together with subsidiaries <ORGANIZATION>OMLX</ORGANIZATION> , the <ORGANIZATION>London Securities & Derivatives Exchange</ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION>OM Stockholm</ORGANIZATION> , <ORGANIZATION>OM Gruppen</ORGANIZATION> will open an international electronic bourse for forest products in the first half of 1997 , " <ORGANIZATION>OM Gruppen</ORGANIZATION> said in a statement .</S>
<S>The first commodity to be traded on the <ORGANIZATION>PULPEX</ORGANIZATION> bourse will be pulp , but <ORGANIZATION>OM</ORGANIZATION> said trade would be extended to include products such as timber , recycled paper and other paper qualities .</S>
<S>" Through the establishment of <ORGANIZATION>PULPEX</ORGANIZATION> , <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> will have a commodities bourse for forest products which complements existing bourses for oil , metals and ' softs ' ( coffee , sugar and cocoa ) , " <ORGANIZATION>OM</ORGANIZATION> said .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>PULPEX</ORGANIZATION> was the result of a three-year project run in cooperation between <ORGANIZATION>OM</ORGANIZATION> and representatives of the forest industry , the company said .</S>
<S>Huge swings in the price of pulp over the past few years have made pulp producers ' profitability unpredictable , and made investing in new production capacity a risky business .</S>
<S>" Without the ability to hedge prices , changes in the world market price for pulp has had an immediate impact on players ' profitability , " <ORGANIZATION>OM</ORGANIZATION> said .</S>
<S>It said global production of pulp amounted to around 200 million tonnes per year , of which around 20 percent or 40 million tonnes was sold on the spot market .</S>
<S>At current prices , the value of this production was around $ 25 billion .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>PULPEX</ORGANIZATION> will be both a marketplace and a clearing house , <ORGANIZATION>OM</ORGANIZATION> said , adding that the <ORGANIZATION>British Securities and Investments Board</ORGANIZATION> had been informed of <ORGANIZATION>OM</ORGANIZATION>'s plans .</S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>PULPEX</ORGANIZATION>'s clearing operation will be covered by the parent company guarantee issued by <ORGANIZATION>OM Gruppen</ORGANIZATION> to its wholly-owned bourses and clearing organisations .</S>

<S>INTERVIEW-T&N untroubled by margin pressure .</S>

<S>The chairman of British-based components and engineering group <ORGANIZATION>T&N Plc</ORGANIZATION> said on Thursday the firm remained confident about the general prospects for its operating margins despite pressure from unsettled markets .</S>
<S>In an interview following its first-half results , which included a less optimistic forecast for the second half of this year than it had made in the past , Sir <PERSON>Colin Hope</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>T&N</ORGANIZATION> had taken defensive action to protect it from patchy markets .</S>
<S>Looking at market prospects , he said : " I think our best judgment at this stage is that it will probably bumble along in the rather mixed way it's been in the first half . "</S>
<S>" It's very difficult to predict the market ( trend ) this year .</S>
<S>It could be better , or it could be worse , " <PERSON>Hope</PERSON> added , echoing the demand uncertainty across automotive industries .</S>
<S>" You can see anxieties in <LOCATION>Germany</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> , in particular , beginning to grow and develop .</S>
<S><LOCATION>America</LOCATION> , however , is looking a little better , " he said .</S>
<S>Compared with the end of last year , when <ORGANIZATION>T&N</ORGANIZATION> predicted a sluggish first half and a rebound later in 1996 , <PERSON>Hope</PERSON> said : " I think the difference ( now ) is the first half has not actually been as bad as some felt it was going to be , but equally we're certainly not predicting a recovery in the second half .

<S>Against this background , <PERSON>Hope</PERSON> said the group was glad it had rationalised and destocked even though this had pressed margins , which had slipped to 9.5 percent from 11.3 percent a year ago .</S>
<S>" I think the figure of 9.5 percent on the first half , when you consider the fact that we've been destocking , the fairly mixed customer demand , and the fact that we sold the ( southern African ) mines actually is not bad .</S>
<S>" It does show how easily we should be able to bounce back over 10 percent again , " he added , saying : " We continue to feel very relaxed about our general view that we would average 10 percent profit margins over the cycle . "</S>
<S>" We've always taken the view that we are the sort of company that's quite capable of working in difficult circumstances -- we're rather used to it .</S>
<S>And we feel very confident that we're doing all the right things , " <PERSON>Hope</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>" When the ( profit ) figures will bounce back up again is just a function of markets recovering just a fraction , " he added .</S>
<S>Commenting on the continued struggle to get control of German piston maker <ORGANIZATION>Kolbenschmidt</ORGANIZATION> , which has been hampered by regulatory obstacles , <PERSON>Hope</PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION>T&N</ORGANIZATION>'s confidence " continues to improve " that it may eventually be able to proceed .</S>

<S><PERSON>Mark Trevelyan</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>WELLINGTON</LOCATION> 1996-08-29</S>
<S><LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> Financial Secretary <PERSON>Donald Tsang</PERSON> said on Thursday he expected the territory's economy to keep growing at around five percent but with some fluctuations from year to year .</S>
<S><PERSON>Tsang</PERSON> , who made the remarks during a visit to <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> , also spoke strongly in favour of keeping the <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> dollar pegged to its <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> counterpart , and said negotiations with <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> on next year's budget were going smoothly .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>'s economy grew by only 3.1 percent in the first quarter , down from 5.9 percent a year earlier , and some private sector economists have revised downwards their predictions for the 1996 year .</S>
<S>Second quarter growth estimates will be released when the <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> government issues its half-yearly economic report on Friday .</S>
<S>" Our trend growth rate of five percent in real terms is pretty solid , " <PERSON>Tsang</PERSON> told a news conference after meeting <LOCATION>New Zealand</LOCATION> Finance Minister <PERSON>Bill Birch</PERSON> .</S>
<S>" There will be fluctuations in individual years , but it won't be a big margin , " he said .</S>
<S>He said inflation was under control and the <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> dollar was " rock solid " .</S>
<S>Its link to the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> dollar had proved an engine of growth for the past 12 years .</S>
<S>" There's absolutely no economic or financial or political reason for us to change .</S>
<S>A lot of investment in <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> , some of which ( is ) by <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> , is predicated on the link continuing . "</S>
<S><LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> will hand over <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> to Chinese sovereignty at midnight on June 30 , 1997 .</S>
<S><PERSON>Tsang</PERSON> said three sets of meetings with Chinese authorities on <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>'s 1997-98 budget , which will span the transition period , had gone smoothly . "</S>
<S>None of our basic precepts have been challenged . "</S>
<S><LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> will retain its own currency after the handover , run its own financial and monetary policy and have control over its own foreign exchange reserves .</S>
<S>It will have no duty to contribute any taxes to <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> , <PERSON>Tsang</PERSON> said .</S>
<S>He described the condition of the property market as " very good indeed " .</S>
<S>" You know , we went through a little climb and a little trough over the last few years .</S>
<S>Because of speculation in the market we introduced certain measures , but they are not draconian measures , and we brought it down to earth . "</S>
<S><PERSON>Tsang</PERSON> said the market would continue to appreciate because property and land were scarce .</S>
<S>The government would put land on the market to stop rentals " going through the roof " , but this would mean reclamation , with possible environmental problems .</S>
<S>" There will be on the whole a slightly upward climb , consistent with our economic growth rate , " he said in reference to the property market .</S>
<S><PERSON>Tsang</PERSON> , the third senior figure in the government after the governor and chief secretary , said his stated aim was to serve as financial secretary for two years under British rule and three years under <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> .</S>

<S>Senior <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> civil servants were given the go-ahead on Thursday to challenge a government ban on them standing for the Beijing-backed panel to choose the territory's first post-handover leader and lawmakers .</S>
<S>The <ORGANIZATION>Supreme Court</ORGANIZATION> ruled that a judicial hearing contesting the ban would be heard on September 11 , three days before the nomination period for the <ORGANIZATION>Selection Committee</ORGANIZATION> closes .</S>
<S>The government maintains the ban , announced earlier this month , is necessary to avoid a possible conflict of interest because civil servants are involved in determining government policy .</S>
<S>Civil servants argue the ban stymies their political rights .</S>
<S>The 400-strong <ORGANIZATION>Selection Committee</ORGANIZATION> will select <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>'s future chief executive to replace the British governor and a provisional legislature to take over from the elected chamber which <LOCATION>Beijing</LOCATION> plans to dissolve .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION> , a British colony for more than 150 years , will be handed back to <LOCATION>China</LOCATION> at midnight on June 30 next year .</S>
<S><LOCATION>China</LOCATION> intends to dismantle the territory's first fully-elected legislature because it opposes <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION>'s recent electoral reforms and install an interim appointed chamber , a decision that has generated considerable controversy .</S>
<S>The judicial review sought by directorate-grade bureaucrats will apply to only about 1,000 of the approximately 33,000 civil servants affected .</S>
<S>Police unions are not contesting the ban , which affects all 27,000 officers , and nor are the very top tier of <LOCATION>Hong Kong</LOCATION>'s mandarin class , the policy secretaries .</S>

<S><LOCATION>Algeria</LOCATION> , fighting a vicious war against Moslem fundamentalist guerrillas , attacked <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> on Wednesday for allowing Islamist groups to meet in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>The Islamist gathering , due to be held in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> on September 8 , has triggered concern and anger in several other Arab countries like <LOCATION>Egypt</LOCATION> which is also fighting armed Moslem fundamentalists .</S>
<S>British Jewish groups have also voiced protest because they said Palestinian Islamist <ORGANIZATION>Hamas</ORGANIZATION> as well as the banned Algerian <ORGANIZATION>Islamic Salvation Front</ORGANIZATION> ( <ORGANIZATION>FIS</ORGANIZATION> ) are among those radical Islamists attending the conference .</S>
<S>A foreign ministry spokesman said in a statement read on Algerian television that <LOCATION>Algeria</LOCATION> " has received with concern the information over a meeting of terrorist groups working against the interests of the Arab and Islamic world . "</S>
<S>" <LOCATION>Algeria</LOCATION> expresses its sharp rejection of a meeting putting together masterminds and ideologists and financers of terrorism , " the spokesman said , adding the Algerian government has asked the British embassy in <LOCATION>Algiers</LOCATION> for clarifications .</S>
<S>The Algerian ambassador in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> has also asked for clarification from the <ORGANIZATION>Foreign Office</ORGANIZATION> over the meeting of Islamist groups .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Algeria</LOCATION> said " they are clearly working to undermine the stability " of Arab countries .</S>
<S>British Foreign Secretary <PERSON>Malcolm Rifkind</PERSON> said on Tuesday from <LOCATION>Pakistan</LOCATION> his government would only take action against the planned Islamists gathering in <LOCATION>London</LOCATION> if British law was broken .</S>
<S>" People who wish to hold conferences of course don't need to seek permission from the government in <LOCATION>Britain</LOCATION> , " he said .</S>
<S>An estimated 50,000 people , including more than 110 foreigners , have been killed in <LOCATION>Algeria</LOCATION>'s violence pitting Moslem rebels against government forces since early 1992 when authorities in <LOCATION>Algeria</LOCATION> cancelled a general election in which <ORGANIZATION>FIS</ORGANIZATION> had taken a commanding lead .</S>

<S><LOCATION>Wall Street</LOCATION> ponders <PERSON>Rubin</PERSON>'s role if <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> wins .</S>
<S><PERSON>Donna Sells</PERSON></S>
<S><LOCATION>NEW YORK</LOCATION></S>
<S>The outcome of the November elections emerged as a hot topic on <LOCATION>Wall Street</LOCATION> this week as financial pundits debated whether <PERSON>Robert Rubin</PERSON> might forgo a second term as <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> secretary if President <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> is re-elected .</S>
<S>Concern centred on the currency markets since <PERSON>Rubin</PERSON>'s tour de force has been his unflagging support of the dollar .</S>
<S>Speculation that <PERSON>Rubin</PERSON> might not stay in his post grew after he sidestepped questions about any future <ORGANIZATION>Cabinet</ORGANIZATION> post during television interviews at the Democratic convention in <LOCATION>Chicago</LOCATION> this week .</S>
<S>Should <PERSON>Rubin</PERSON> leave , <LOCATION>Wall Street</LOCATION> would worry that he might take his strong-dollar policy with him .</S>
<S><PERSON>Rubin</PERSON>'s predecessor at the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> , <PERSON>Lloyd Bentsen</PERSON> , was viewed with suspicion by some in the financial markets who thought he had tried to push down the dollar to gain an edge in trade negotiations with <LOCATION>Japan</LOCATION> .</S>
<S>" Obviously , under the <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> administration , we've seen two distinctively different dollar policies , " said <PERSON>Chris Widness</PERSON> , an international economist at <ORGANIZATION>Chase Securities Inc.</ORGANIZATION> " Under <PERSON>Rubin</PERSON> , the <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> has certainly looked for a strong dollar . "</S>
<S>That strategy , backed up by timely instances of joint central bank intervention , helped the dollar battle back from post-Second World War lows of 1.3438 German marks on March 8 , 1995 , and 79.75 Japanese yen on April 19 , 1995 .</S>
<S>Currently , the dollar stands at about 1.48 marks and 109 yen .</S>
<S><PERSON>Rubin</PERSON> was widely hailed as the architect of the dollar's comeback , using skills and expertise gained in 26 years on <LOCATION>Wall Street</LOCATION> , part of which were spent as co-chairman of <ORGANIZATION>Goldman , Sachs and Co .</ORGANIZATION></S>
<S><ORGANIZATION>Inc</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>" <PERSON>Rubin</PERSON> has done a fine job in that position , " said <PERSON>Michael Faust</PERSON> , a portfolio manager at <ORGANIZATION>Bailard , Biehl and Kaiser</ORGANIZATION> , which manages just under $ 1 billion in global stocks and bonds .</S>
<S>" Anyone who would come in there to replace him would have awfully big shoes to fill . "</S>
<S>Fear that a new <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> secretary might favour a return to Bentsen-era policy could spell trouble for financial markets .</S>
<S>Some overseas investors might shy away from buying <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> stocks and bonds or even sell them when the dollar is weakening .</S>
<S>As for <ORGANIZATION>U.S. Treasury</ORGANIZATION> securities , <PERSON>Widness</PERSON> explained that <PERSON>Alan Greenspan</PERSON>'s reappointment as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION>Federal Reserve</ORGANIZATION> and the outlook for the federal budget were more important than whether <PERSON>Rubin</PERSON> continues at the <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>" Although , if we did get someone that was seen as looking for a dollar depreciation , it would probably hurt capital flows to the <LOCATION>United States</LOCATION> , " said <PERSON>Widness</PERSON> , adding that could hurt <LOCATION>U.S.</LOCATION> stocks and , to a lesser degree , bonds .</S>
<S>Still , markets may have little to fear from any <PERSON>Rubin</PERSON> successor because the firm dollar policy has yielded positive results .</S>
<S>If that is true , then any new <ORGANIZATION>Treasury</ORGANIZATION> chief would need to be as effective as <PERSON>Rubin</PERSON> in convincing markets that the <LOCATION>White House</LOCATION> does indeed want a strong currency .</S>
<S>" If he left , the first question people would ask the next guy is , ' What's your view on the dollar ? '</S>
<S>" said <PERSON>Michael Perelstein</PERSON> , portfolio manager of <ORGANIZATION>MainStay International Funds</ORGANIZATION> .</S>
<S>" And all I can say as a piece of advice is that they'd better say exactly the same thing ( as <PERSON>Rubin</PERSON> ) , if not stronger , " <PERSON>Perelstein</PERSON> said . "</S>
<S>Otherwise , you get selling out of <LOCATION>Tokyo</LOCATION> and <LOCATION>Frankfurt</LOCATION> again . "</S>

<S><PERSON>Ballanger</PERSON> , 25 , will be aiming to complete a track double when she defends her 500 metres time trial title on Saturday .</S>
<S>The other final of the night , the women's 24-kms points race , also ended in success for the reigning champion .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION>'s <PERSON>Svetlana Samokhalova</PERSON> fought off a spirited challenge from American <PERSON>Jane Quigley</PERSON> to take the title for a second year .</S>
<S><LOCATION>Russia</LOCATION> , the only nation to have two riders in the field , made full use of their numerical superiority .</S>
<S><PERSON>Goulnara Fatkoullina</PERSON> helped <PERSON>Samokhalova</PERSON> to build an unbeatable points lead before snatching the bronze medal .</S>
<S><PERSON>Quigley</PERSON> , a former medallist in the points event , led the race at half distance . "</S>
<S>I went so close this time , but having two riders certainly gave the Russians an advantage , " she said .</S>
<S>The first six riders lapped the field , which left former world champion <PERSON>Ingrid Haringa</PERSON> of the <LOCATION>Netherlands</LOCATION> down in seventh place despite having the second highest points score .</S>
<S>Olympic champion <PERSON>Nathalie Lancien</PERSON> of <LOCATION>France</LOCATION> also missed the winning attack and finished a disappointing 10th .</S>
